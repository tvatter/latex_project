In addition we extend the mean specification to include within- and between-cluster effects. The method is illustrated through the analysis of data from two studies. In the first study, cross-sectional count data from a randomised controlled trial are analysed to evaluate the efficacy of a communication skills training programme. The second study involves longitudinal count data which represent counts of damaged hand joints in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Motivated by this study, we generalize our model to accommodate for a subpopulation of patients who are not susceptible to the development of damaged hand joints.},

We undertake in-sample and out-of-sample tests using daily electricity prices, and evidence that our model provides accurate forecasts of the underlying distribution and outperforms a set of competing models in their abilities to forecast one-day-ahead conditional quantiles of a portfolio of electricity prices. Our study is conducted in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which is the most efficient power auction in the world. Electricity prices exhibit highly stylised features such as extreme price spikes, price dependency between regional markets, correlation asymmetry and non-linear dependency. The developed approach can be used as a risk management tool in the electricity retail industry, which plays an integral role in the apparatus of modern energy markets. Electricity retailers are responsible for the efficient distribution of electricity, while being exposed to market risk with extreme magnitudes.},

@article{mahmoudi2016estimating,
abstract = {One of the basic aims in science is to unravel the chain of cause and effect of particular systems. Especially for large systems this can be a daunting task. Detailed interventional and randomized data sampling approaches can be used to resolve the causality question, but for many systems such interventions are impossible or too costly to obtain. Recently, Maathuis et al. (2010), following ideas from Spirtes et al. (2000), introduced a framework to estimate causal effects in large scale Gaussian systems. By describing the causal network as a directed acyclic graph it is a possible to estimate a class of Markov equivalent systems that describe the underlying causal interactions consistently, even for non-Gaussian systems. In these systems, causal effects stop being linear and cannot be described any more by a single coefficient. In this paper, we derive the general functional form of causal effect in a large subclass of non-Gaussian distributions, called the non- paranormal. We also derive a convenient approximation, which can be used effectively in estimation. We apply the method to an observational gene expression dataset.},

This problem penalizes the 1 norm of a matrix D times the coefficient vector, and has a wide range of applications, dictated by the choice of D. Our algorithm is based on solving the dual of the generalized lasso, which greatly facilitates computation of the path. For D = I (the usual lasso), we draw a connection between our approach and the well-known LARS algorithm. For an arbitrary D, we derive an unbiased estimate of the degrees of freedom of the generalized lasso fit. This estimate turns out to be quite intuitive in many applications.},

High-frequency log-returns feature important kurtosis (fat tails) and volatility clustering (extreme log-returns appear in clusters) that VaR models should take into account. We propose a marked point process model for the excesses of the time series over a high threshold that combines Hawkes processes for the exceedances with a generalized Pareto distribution model for the marks (exceedance sizes). The conditional approach features intraday clustering of extremes and is used to calculate instantaneous conditional VaR. The models are backtested on real data and compared to a competitor approach that proposes a nonparametric extension of the classical peaks-over-threshold method. Maximum likelihood estimation is computationally intensive; we use a differential evolution genetic algorithm to find adequate starting values for the optimization process.},

  abstract  = {The FoxM1 transcription factor gene is overexpressed in cancer. Its expression is stimulated by oncogenic signaling pathways and reactive oxygen species. It is also a target of regulation by the tumor suppressor genes. The transcriptional activity of FoxM1 depends upon activation by cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases as well as Plk1. FoxM1 stimulates expression of several genes involved in the cell cycle progression. Moreover, it supports proliferation of tumor cells by stimulating expression of the antioxidant genes and reducing oxidative stress. A new study provides evidence that FoxM1, in the absence of its inhibitor, the tumor suppressor Arf, drives metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It induces an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition phenotype in HCC cells, increases cell migration, and induces premetastatic niche at the distal organ of metastasis. FoxM1 directly activates genes involved in multiple steps of metastasis. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a master regulatory role of FoxM1 in tumor metastasis.},

In this paper, we consider a class of functions composed of waveforms that repeat nearly periodically, and for which the instantaneous frequency can be given a rigorous meaning. We show that Synchrosqueezing can be used to determine the instantaneous frequency of functions in this class, even if the waveform is not harmonic, thus generalizing earlier results for cosine wave functions. We also provide real-life examples and discuss the advantages, for these examples, of considering such non-harmonic waveforms.},

  abstract  = {A general theory on rates of convergence of the least-squares projection estimate in multiple regression is developed. The theory is applied to the functional ANOVA model, where the multivariate regression function is modeled as a specified sum of a constant term, main effects (functions of one variable) and selected interaction terms (functions of two or more variables). The least-squares projection is onto an approximating space constructed from arbitrary linear spaces of functions and their tensor products respecting the assumed ANOVA structure of the regression function. The linear spaces that serve as building blocks can be any of the ones commonly used in practice: polynomials, trigonometric polynomials, splines, wavelets and finite elements. The rate of convergence result that is obtained reinforces the intuition that low-order ANOVA modeling can achieve dimension reduction and thus overcome the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, the components of the projection estimate in an appropriately defined ANOVA decomposition provide consistent estimates of the corresponding components of the regression function. When the regression function does not satisfy the assumed ANOVA form, the projection estimate converges to its best approximation of that form.

Different graphs may result in different causal inference statements and different intervention distributions. To quantify such differences, we propose a (pre-)metric between DAGs, the structural intervention distance (SID). The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs, it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially DAGs that represent Markov equivalence classes. The SID differs significantly from the widely used structural Hamming distance and therefore constitutes a valuable additional measure. We discuss properties of this distance and provide a (reasonably) efficient implementation with software code available on the first author's home page.},

We demonstrate that in special cases, realized bipower variation estimates integrated variance in stochastic volatility models, thus providing a model-free and consistent alternative to realized variance. Its robustness property means that if we have a stochastic volatility plus infrequent jumps process, then the difference between realized variance and realized bipower variation estimates the quadratic variation of the jump component. This seems to be the first method that can separate quadratic variation into its continuous and jump components. Various extensions are given, together with proofs of special cases of these results. Detailed mathematical results are reported in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003a).},

This lack has not only hindered systematic discussion, it has served to confuse the connections between "casuality" and "exogeneity". Moreover, many existing definitions have been formulated in terms of disturbances from relationships which contain unknown parameters, yet whether or not such disturbances satisfy certain orthogonality conditions with other observables may be a matter of construction or may be a testable hypothesis : a clear distinction between these situations is essential. To achieve such an objective, we formulate definitions in terms of the distributions of the observable variables, distinguishing between exogeneity assumptions and causality assumptions, where causality is used in the sense of Granger (1969). Following in particular Koopman's pioneering article (1950), exogeneity will be related to the statistical completeness of a model. In short, a variable will be considered exogenous for a given purpose if a statistical analysis can be conducted conditionally on that variable without loss or relevant sample information (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  abstract = {For multivariate copula-based models for which maximum likelihood is computationally difficult, a two-stage estimation procedure has been proposed previously; the first stage involves maximum likelihood from univariate margins, and the second stage involves maximum likelihood of the dependence parameters with the univariate parameters held fixed from the first stage. Using the theory of inference functions, a partitioned matrix in a form amenable to analysis is obtained for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the two-stage estimator. The asymptotic relative efficiency of the two-stage estimation procedure compared with maximum likelihood estimation is studied. Analysis of the limiting cases of the independence copula and Fr{\'{e}}chet upper bound help to determine common patterns in the efficiency as the dependence in the model increases. For the Fr{\'{e}}chet upper bound, the two-stage estimation procedure can sometimes be equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation for the univariate parameters. Numerical results are shown for some models, including multivariate ordinal probit and bivariate extreme value distributions, to indicate the typical level of asymptotic efficiency for discrete and continuous data.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019, arXiv, All rights reserved. We present an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to value financial derivatives. Atypically to standard ANN applications, practitioners equally use option pricing models to validate market prices and to infer unobserved prices. Importantly, models need to generate realistic arbitrage-free prices, meaning that no option portfolio can lead to risk-free profits. The absence of arbitrage opportunities is guaranteed by penalizing the loss using soft constraints on an extended grid of input values. ANNs can be pre-trained by first calibrating a standard option pricing model, and then training an ANN to a larger synthetic dataset generated from the calibrated model. The parameters transfer as well as the non-arbitrage constraints appear to be particularly useful when only sparse or erroneous data are available. We also explore how deeper ANNs improve over shallower ones, as well as other properties of the network architecture. We benchmark our method against standard option pricing models, such as Heston with and without jumps. We validate our method both on training sets, and testing sets, namely, highlighting both their capacity to reproduce observed prices and predict new ones.},

abstract = {We present a neural network (NN) approach to fit and predict implied volatility surfaces (IVSs). Atypically to standard NN applications, financial industry practitioners use such models equally to replicate market prices and to value other financial instruments. In other words, low training losses are as important as generalization capabilities. Importantly, IVS models need to generate realistic arbitrage-free option prices, meaning that no portfolio can lead to risk-free profits. We propose an approach guaranteeing the absence of arbitrage opportunities by penalizing the loss using soft constraints. Furthermore, our method can be combined with standard IVS models in quantitative finance, thus providing a NN-based correction when such models fail at replicating observed market prices. This lets practitioners use our approach as a plug-in on top of classical methods. Empirical results show that this approach is particularly useful when only sparse or erroneous data are available. We also quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions in regions with few or no observations. We further explore how deeper NNs improve over shallower ones, as well as other properties of the network architecture. We benchmark our method against standard IVS models.

However, its identifiability has not been properly addressed, and how to apply it in the case of more than two variables is also a problem. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on its identifiability in the two-variable case. We show that this model is identifiable in most cases; by enumerating all possible situations in which the model is not identifiable, we provide sufficient conditions for its identifiability. Simulations are given to support the theoretical results. Moreover, in the case of more than two variables, we show that the whole causal structure can be found by applying the {PNL} causal model to each structure in the Markov equivalent class and testing if the disturbance is independent of the direct causes for each variable. In this way the exhaustive search over all possible causal structures is avoided.},

Let X and Y denote the features and target, respectively, previous work on domain adapta-tion mainly considers the covariate shift situa-tion where the distribution of the features P (X) changes across domains while the conditional distribution P (Y |X) stays the same. To re-duce domain discrepancy, recent methods try to find invariant components T (X) that have sim-ilar P (T (X)) on different domains by explic-itly minimizing a distribution discrepancy mea-sure. However, it is not clear if P (Y |T (X)) in different domains is also similar when P (Y |X) changes. Furthermore, transferable components do not necessarily have to be invariant. If the change in some components is identifiable, we can make use of such components for prediction in the target domain. In this paper, we focus on the case where P (X|Y) and P (Y) both change in a causal system in which Y is the cause for X. Under appropriate assumptions, we aim to ex-tract conditional transferable components whose conditional distribution P (T (X)|Y) is invariant after proper location-scale (LS) transformation-s, and identify how P (Y) changes between do-mains simultaneously. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on both syn-thetic and real-world data to show the effective-ness of our method.},

The number and locations of the piecewise AR segments, as well as the orders of the respective AR processes, are assumed unknown. The minimum description length principle is applied to compare various segmented AR fits to the data. The goal is to find the ?best? combination of the number of segments, the lengths of the segments, and the orders of the piecewise AR processes. Such a ?best? combination is implicitly defined as the optimizer of an objective function, and a genetic algorithm is implemented to solve this difficult optimization problem. Numerical results from simulation experiments and real data analyses show that the procedure has excellent empirical properties. The segmentation of multivariate time series is also considered. Assuming that the true underlying model is a segmented autoregression, this procedure is shown to be consistent for estimating the location of the breaks.},

The main contribution, however, is in providing a means to perform these two tasks simultaneously. This is achieved by matching the data with the best-fitting piecewise quantile regression model, where the fit is determined by a penalization derived from the minimum description length principle. The resulting optimization problem is solved with the use of genetic algorithms. The proposed, fully automatic procedures are, unlike traditional break point procedures, not based on repeated hypothesis tests, and do not require, unlike most variable selection procedures, the specification of a tuning parameter. Theoretical large-sample properties are derived. Empirical comparisons with existing break point and variable selection methods for quantiles indicate that the new procedures work well in practice.},

We progress by using newly developed bipower variation measures and corresponding nonparametric tests for jumps. Our empirical analyses of exchange rates, equity index returns, and bond yields suggest that the volatility jump component is both highly important and distinctly less persistent than the continuous component, and that separating the rough jump moves from the smooth continuous moves results in significant out-of-sample volatility forecast improvements. Moreover, many of the significant jumps are associated with specific macroeconomic news announcements.

The proposed method is based on a known assumption that, if X → Y (X causes Y), the marginal distri-bution of the cause, P (X), contains no in-formation about the conditional distribution P (Y |X). Consequently, estimating P (Y |X) from P (X) should not be possible. However, estimating P (X|Y) based on P (Y) may be possible. This paper employs this asymmetry to pro-pose CURE, a causal discovery method which decides upon the causal direction by com-paring the accuracy of the estimations of P (Y |X) and P (X|Y). To this end, we pro-pose a method for estimating a conditional from samples of the corresponding marginal, which we call unsupervised inverse GP re-gression. We evaluate CURE on synthetic and real data. On the latter, our method outperforms existing causal inference meth-ods.},

Time series of monthly temperature and precipitation were evaluated because of their importance for climate studies and because they represent two important types of statistics (additive and multiplicative). The algorithms were validated against a realistic benchmark dataset. The benchmark contains real inhomogeneous data as well as simulated data with inserted inhomogeneities. Random independent break-type inhomogeneities with nor- mally distributed breakpoint sizes were added to the simu- lated datasets. To approximate real world conditions, breaks were introduced that occur simultaneously in multiple station series within a simulated network of station data. The sim- ulated time series also contained outliers, missing data peri- ods and local station trends. Further, a stochastic nonlinear global (network-wide) trend was added},

  abstract = {— In this paper, we deal with the problem of inferring causal relations for multidimensional data. Based on the postulate that the distribution of the cause and the conditional distribution of the effect given cause are generated independently, we show that the covariance matrix of the mean embedding of the cause in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is free independent with the covariance matrix of the conditional embedding of the effect given cause. This, called freeness condition, induces a cause–effect asymmetry that a designed measurement is 0 in the causal direction but smaller than 0 in the anticausal direction, and it uncovers the causal direction. One important novel aspect of this paper is that we interpret the independence as a freeness condition between covariance matrices of RKHS distribution embeddings, and it has a wide applicability. We show that our freeness condition-based inference method succeeds in scenarios like additive noise cases, where other methods fail, by theoretical analysis and experimental results.},

  year          = {2017},
  abstract      = {Discovering causal relations is fundamental to reasoning and intelligence. In particular, observational causal discovery algorithms estimate the cause-effect relation between two random entities $X$ and $Y$, given $n$ samples from $P(X,Y)$. In this paper, we develop a framework to estimate the cause-effect relation between two static entities $x$ and $y$: for instance, an art masterpiece $x$ and its fraudulent copy $y$. To this end, we introduce the notion of proxy variables, which allow the construction of a pair of random entities $(A,B)$ from the pair of static entities $(x,y)$. Then, estimating the cause-effect relation between $A$ and $B$ using an observational causal discovery algorithm leads to an estimation of the cause-effect relation between $x$ and $y$. For example, our framework detects the causal relation between unprocessed photographs and their modifications, and orders in time a set of shuffled frames from a video. As our main case study, we introduce a human-elicited dataset of 10,000 pairs of casually-linked pairs of words from natural language. Our methods discover 75% of these causal relations. Finally, we discuss the role of proxy variables in machine learning, as a general tool to incorporate static knowledge into prediction tasks.},

A key component of our approach is to decouple order search among the variables from feature or edge selection in a directed acyclic graph encoding the causal structure. We show that the former can be done with non-regularized (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation while the latter can be efficiently addressed using sparse regression techniques. Thus, we substantially simplify the problem of structure search and estimation for an important class of causal models. We establish consistency of the (restricted) maximum likelihood estimator for low- and high-dimensional scenarios, and we also allow for misspecification of the error distribution. Furthermore, we develop an efficient computational algorithm which can deal with many variables, and the new method's accuracy and performance is illustrated on simulated and real data.},

This paper proposes a supervised machine learning approach to infer the existence of a directed causal link between two variables in multivariate settings with $n>2$ variables. The approach relies on the asymmetry of some conditional (in)dependence relations between the members of the Markov blankets of two variables causally connected.

For scanning statistics, due to local dependence, clusters of neighbouring hypotheses are likely to be rejected together. In such situations, it is more intuitive and informative to group neighbouring rejections together and count them as a single discovery, with the false discovery rate defined as the proportion of clusters that are falsely declared among all declared clusters. Assuming that the number of false discoveries, under this broader definition of a discovery, is approximately Poisson and independent of the number of true discoveries, we examine approaches for estimating and controlling the false discovery rate, and provide examples from biological applications.},

A two-parameter version of the model is a simple and appealing alternative to the Gaussian copula model. One of the parameters in this model is used to match spreads. The other can be implied from tranche quotes and is much less variable across the capital structure than base correlation. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous versions of the model are presented and the differences between the results obtained from these two versions of the model are examined. Results are also presented for the situation where hazard rates are driven by more than one factor.},

  abstract      = {When facing multivariate covariates, general semiparametric regression techniques come at hand to propose flexible models that are unexposed to the curse of dimensionality. In this work a semiparametric copula-based estimator for conditional quantiles is investigated for complete or right-censored data. In spirit, the methodology is extending the recent work of Noh et al. (2013) and Noh et al. (2015), as the main idea consists in appropriately defining the quantile regression in terms of a multivariate copula and marginal distributions. Prior estimation of the latter and simple plug-in lead to an easily implementable estimator expressed, for both contexts with or without censoring, as a weighted quantile of the observed response variable. In addition, and contrary to the initial suggestion in the literature, a semiparametric estimation scheme for the multivariate copula density is studied, motivated by the possible shortcomings of a purely parametric approach and driven by the regression context. The resulting quantile regression estimator has the valuable property of being automatically monotonic across quantile levels, and asymptotic normality for both complete and censored data is obtained under classical regularity conditions. Finally, numerical examples as well as a real data application are used to illustrate the validity and finite sample performance of the proposed procedure.},

  abstract      = {When the copula of the conditional distribution of two random variables given a covariate does not depend on the value of the covariate, two conflicting intuitions arise about the best possible rate of convergence attainable by nonparametric estimators of that copula. In the end, any such estimator must be based on the marginal conditional distribution functions of the two dependent variables given the covariate, and the best possible rates for estimating such localized objects is slower than the parametric one. However, the invariance of the conditional copula given the value of the covariate suggests the possibility of parametric convergence rates. The more optimistic intuition is shown to be correct, confirming a conjecture supported by extensive Monte Carlo simulations by I. Hobaek Haff and J. Segers [Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 84:1--13, 2015] and improving upon the nonparametric rate obtained theoretically by I. Gijbels, M. Omelka and N. Veraverbeke [Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 2015, to appear]. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the double smoothing procedure employed for the estimator of the marginal cumulative distribution functions. Under mild conditions on the bandwidth sequence, the estimator is shown to take values in a certain class of smooth functions, the class having sufficiently small entropy for empirical process arguments to work. The copula estimator itself is asymptotically undistinguishable from a kind of oracle empirical copula, making it appear as if the marginal conditional distribution functions were known.},

In the case of histogram estimators, we derive a simple, exact formula for stochastic complexity when the prior distribution of cell probabilities is uniform over the class of all possible choices. The formula depends only on the data and the smoothing parameter, which is readily chosen according to the criterion of minimum stochastic complexity. Approaches based on stochastic complexity and description length are shown to be asymptotically equivalent in certain circumstances. They produce a degree of smoothing which is almost optimal from the viewpoint of minimizing L°°, or supremum, distance, but which smooths a little more than is optimal in the sense of minimizing V distance for any finite value of r.},

  title    = {{Flexible Transfer Learning under Support and Model Shift}},
  abstract = {Transfer learning algorithms are used when one has sufficient training data for one supervised learning task (the source/training domain) but only very limited training data for a second task (the target/test domain) that is similar but not iden-tical to the first. Previous work on transfer learning has focused on relatively restricted settings, where specific parts of the model are considered to be car-ried over between tasks. Recent work on covariate shift focuses on matching the marginal distributions on observations X across domains. Similarly, work on target/conditional shift focuses on matching marginal distributions on labels Y and adjusting conditional distributions P (X|Y), such that P (X) can be matched across domains. However, covariate shift assumes that the support of test P (X) is contained in the support of training P (X), i.e., the training set is richer than the test set. Target/conditional shift makes a similar assumption for P (Y). Moreover, not much work on transfer learning has considered the case when a few labels in the test domain are available. Also little work has been done when all marginal and conditional distributions are allowed to change while the changes are smooth. In this paper, we consider a general case where both the support and the model change across domains. We transform both X and Y by a location-scale shift to achieve transfer between tasks. Since we allow more flexible transformations, the proposed method yields better results on both synthetic data and real-world data.},

This paper puts several valuation approaches through a crucial test: How did these models perform in one of the worst periods of economic history, September 2008, when Lehman Brothers went under? Did they produce reasonable hedging strategies? We study several bottom-up and top-down credit portfolio models and compute the resulting delta hedging strategies using either index contracts or a portfolio of single-name CDS contracts as hedging instruments. We compute the profit-and-loss profiles and assess the performances of these hedging strategies. Among all 10 pricing models that we consider the Student- t copula model performs best. The dynamical generalized-Poisson loss model is the best top-down model, but this model class has in general problems to hedge equity tranches. Our major finding is however that single-name and index CDS contracts are not appropriate instruments to hedge CDO tranches. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract      = {The increasing popularity of regression discontinuity methods for causal inference in observational studies has led to a proliferation of different estimating strategies, most of which involve first fitting non-parametric regression models on both sides of a threshold and then reporting plug-in estimates for the discontinuity parameter. In applications, however, it is often difficult to tune the non-parametric regressions in a way that is well calibrated for this target of inference; for example, the model with the best global in-sample fit may provide poor estimates of the discontinuity parameter. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for estimation and statistical inference in regression discontinuity designs that uses numerical convex optimization to directly obtain the finite-sample-minimax linear estimator for the regression discontinuity parameter, subject to bounds on the second derivative of the conditional response function. Given a bound on the second derivative, our proposed method is fully data-driven and does not rely on further tuning by the practitioner (e.g., no explicit bandwidth choice is needed). Our approach provides honest confidence intervals for the regression discontinuity parameter with both discrete and continuous running variables, and it naturally extends to the case of multiple running variables.},

  abstract  = {A new methodology for selecting a Bayesian network for continuous data outside the widely used class of multivariate normal distributions is developed. The ‘copula DAGs' combine directed acyclic graphs and their associated probability models with copula C/D-vines. Bivariate copula densities introduce flexibility in the joint distributions of pairs of nodes in the network. An information criterion is studied for graph selection tailored to the joint modeling of data based on graphs and copulas. Examples and simulation studies show the flexibility and properties of the method.},

In Gaussian mod-els, tests of conditional independence are typically based on Pearson correla-tions, and high-dimensional consistency results have been obtained for the PC algorithm in this setting. We prove that high-dimensional consistency carries over to the broader class of Gaussian copula or nonparanormal models when using rank-based measures of correlation. For graphs with bounded degree, our result is as strong as prior Gaussian results. In simulations, the 'Rank PC' algorithm works as well as the 'Pearson PC' algorithm for normal data and considerably better for non-normal Gaussian copula data, all the while incur-ring a negligible increase of computation time. Simulations with contaminated data show that rank correlations can also perform better than other robust es-timates considered in previous work when the underlying distribution does not belong to the nonparanormal family.},

Confidence intervals for such components exhibit good across-the-function coverage probabilities if based on the approximate result , where f is the vector of evaluated values for the smooth component of interest and V f is the covariance matrix for f according to the Bayesian view of the smoothing process. Based on this result, a Wald-type test of f=0 is proposed. It is shown that care must be taken in selecting the rank used in the test statistic. The method complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given by the null space of the component's smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model fits or null distribution simulation.},

This switch in cell differentiation and behaviour is mediated by key transcription factors, including SNAIL, zinc-finger E-box-binding (ZEB) and basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors, the functions of which are finely regulated at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. The reprogramming of gene expression during EMT, as well as non-transcriptional changes, are initiated and controlled by signalling pathways that respond to extracellular cues. Among these, transforming growth factor-[beta] (TGF[beta]) family signalling has a predominant role; however, the convergence of signalling pathways is essential for EMT.},

It is based on a two-step approach. The first step applies Gibbs sampling on rank-based data to obtain samples of correlation matrices. These are then translated into an average correlation matrix and an effective number of data points, which in the second step are input to the standard PC algorithm for causal discovery. A stable version naturally arises when rerunning the PC algorithm on different Gibbs samples. Our ‘Copula PC' algorithm extends the ‘Rank PC' algorithm, which has been designed for Gaussian copula models for purely continuous data. In simulations, ‘Copula PC' indeed outperforms ‘Rank PC' in cases with mixed variables, in particular for larger numbers of data points, at the expense of a slight increase in computation time.},

We show that one can evade the curse of dimensionality by assuming a simplified vine copula model for the dependence between variables. We formulate a general nonparametric estimator for such a model and show under high-level assumptions that the speed of convergence is independent of dimension. We further discuss a particular implementation for which we validate the high-level assumptions and establish its asymptotic normality. Simulation experiments illustrate a large gain in finite sample performance when the simplifying assumption is at least approximately true. But even when it is severely violated, the vine copula based approach proves advantageous as soon as more than a few variables are involved. Lastly, we give an application of the estimator to a classification problem from astrophysics.},

  abstract = {Companies in the same industry sector are usually more correlated than firms in different sectors, as they are similarly affected by macroeconomic effects, political decisions, and consumer trends. Despite the many stock return models taking this fact into account, there are only a few credit default models that take it into consideration. In this paper we present a default model based on nested Archimedean copulas that is able to capture hierarchical dependence structures among the obligors in a credit portfolio. Nested Archimedean copulas have a surprisingly simple and intuitive interpretation. The dependence among all companies in the same sector is described by an inner copula and the sectors are then coupled via an outer copula. Consequently, our model implies a larger default correlation for companies in the same industry sector than for companies in different sectors. A calibration to CDO tranche spreads of the European iTraxx portfolio is performed to demonstrate the fitting capability of the model. This portfolio consists of CDS on 125 companies from six different industry sectors and is therefore an excellent portfolio for a comparison of our generalized model with a traditional copula model of the same family that does not take different sectors into account.},

BRIEF HISTORY The construction of distributions with given marginals started with the seminal papers by Hoeffding (1940) and Fn!chet (1951). Since then, many others have contributed on this topic: Dall' Aglio, Farlie, Gumbel, Johnson, Kellerer, Kotz, Morgenstern, Marshali, Olkin, Strassen, Vitale, Whitt, etc., as weIl as Arnold, Cambanis, Deheuvels, Genest, Frank, Joe, Kirneldorf, Nelsen, R{\"{u}}schendorf, Sampson, Scarsini, Tiit, etc. In 1957 Sklar and Schweizer introduced probabilistic metric spaces. In 1975 Kirneldorf and Sampson studied the uniform representation of a bivariate dis tribution and proposed the desirable conditions that should be satisfied by any bivariate family. In 1991 Darsow, Nguyen and Olsen defined a natural operation between cop ulas, with applications in stochastic processes. In 1993, AIsina, Nelsen and Schweizer introduced the notion of quasi-copula.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre-lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna-tional conference, * * * , 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

We discuss under which conditions the model is identifiable (up to an arbitrary reparameterization of the confounder) from the joint distribution of the effects. We state and prove a theoretical result that provides evidence for the conjecture that the model is generically identifiable under suitable technical conditions. In addition, we propose a practical method to estimate the confounder from a finite i.i.d. sample of the effects and illustrate that the method works well on both simulated and real-world data.},

In Gaussian models, tests of conditional independence are typically based on Pearson correlations, and high-dimensional consistency results have been obtained for the PC algorithm in this setting. Analyzing the error propagation from marginal to partial correlations, we prove that high-dimensional consistency carries over to a broader class of Gaussian copula or nonparanormal models when using rank-based measures of correlation. For graph sequences with bounded degree, our consistency result is as strong as prior Gaussian results. In simulations, the 'Rank PC' algorithm works as well as the 'Pearson PC' algorithm for normal data and considerably better for non-normal data, all the while incurring a negligible increase of computation time. While our interest is in the PC algorithm, the presented analysis of error propagation could be applied to other algorithms that test the vanishing of low-order partial correlations.},

Dependence and tail properties of the model are obtained. The factor copula model can handle multivariate data with tail dependence and tail asymmetry, properties that the multivariate normal copula does not possess. It is a good choice for modeling high-dimensional data as a parametric form can be specified to have O(d) dependence parameters instead of O(d2) parameters. Data examples show that, based on the Akaike information criterion, the factor copula model provides a good fit to financial return data, in comparison with related truncated vine copula models.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018, arXiv, All rights reserved. Mobility datasets are fundamental for evaluating algorithms pertaining to geographic information systems and facilitating experimental reproducibility. But privacy implications restrict sharing such datasets, as even aggregated location-data is vulnerable to membership inference attacks. Current synthetic mobility dataset generators attempt to superficially match a priori modeled mobility characteristics which do not accurately reflect the real-world characteristics. Modeling human mobility to generate synthetic yet semantically and statistically realistic trajectories is therefore crucial for publishing trajectory datasets having satisfactory utility level while preserving user privacy. Specifically, long-range dependencies inherent to human mobility are challenging to capture with both discriminative and generative models. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of recurrent neural architectures (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs) and nonparametric copulas to generate synthetic mobility traces. We evaluate the generated trajectories with respect to their geographic and semantic similarity, circadian rhythms, long-range dependencies, training and generation time. We also include two sample tests to assess statistical similarity between the observed and simulated distributions, and we analyze the privacy tradeoffs with respect to membership inference and location-sequence attacks.},

For inference purposes, however, conditional pair-copulas are often assumed to depend on the conditioning variables only indirectly through the conditional margins. The authors show here that this assumption can be misleading. To assess its validity in trivariate PCCs, they propose a visual tool based on a local likelihood estimator of the conditional copula parameter which does not rely on the simplifying assumption. They establish the consistency of the estimator and assess its performance in finite samples via Monte Carlo simulations. They also provide a real data application.},

We provide the associated estimators and use simulations to show that they behave adequately in the presence of jumps and heteroskedastic and heavy-tailed noise. A study of exchange rate returns sampled from 2010 to 2013 suggests that failing to factor in the seasonality's dynamic properties may lead to misestimation of the intraday spot volatility.},

Integrating this activity over time results in the new {A figure is presented} time scale, characterized by non-seasonal volatility. This scale, applied to dense datastreams of absolute price changes, suceeds in removing most of the seasonal heteroscedasticity in an autocorrelation study. Unexpectedly, the positive autocorrelation is found to decline hyperbolically rather than exponentially as a function of the lag. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

We define a Poisson process construction and introduce multivariate versions of the Smith Gaussian extreme-value, the Schlather extremal-Gaussian and extremal-t, and the Brown-Resnick models. We develop inference for the models based on composite likelihoods. We present results of Monte Carlo simulations and an application to daily maximum wind speed and wind gust.},

Since the number of correlation parameters quadratically increases with the number of variables, parsimonious parameterizations of large correlation matrices in terms of O(d) parameters are important. While factor analysis is commonly used for this purpose, the use of vines is an attractive alternative: vines are graphical models based on a sequence of trees, and are based on the decomposition of a correlation matrix in terms of algebraically independent correlations and partial correlations. By limiting the number of trees, with the so-called truncation, parsimonious parameterizations of correlation matrices may be found. Moreover, truncated vines and factor models may be joined to define a combined model, with individual benefits from each of the two approaches. The different parameterizations and how they are estimated for data are discussed. In particular, spanning tree algorithms for truncated vines and a modified EM algorithm for the combined factor-vine model are proposed and evaluated in a simulation study. Three applications to psychometric and finance data sets illustrate the different parsimonious models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The approach\ntaken by conditional independencebased causal discovery methods is based on two assumptions: the Markov condition and faithfulness. It has been shown that under these assumptions the causal graph can be identified up to Markov equivalence (some arrows remain undirected) using methods like the PC algorithm. In this work we propose an alternative by Identifiable Functional Model Classes (IFMOCs). As our main theorem we prove that if the data generating process belongs to an IFMOC, one can identify the complete causal graph. To the best of our knowledge this is the first identifiability result of this kind that is not limited to linear functional relationships. We discuss\nhow the IFMOC assumption and the Markov and faithfulness assumptions relate to each other and explain why we believe that the IFMOC assumption can be tested more easily on given data. We further provide a practical algorithm that recovers the causal graph from finitely many data; experiments on simulated data support the theoretical fndings.},

The key advantage of this approach to regression is that it does not assume a particular distribution of the noise, i.e., it is non-parametric with respect to the noise distribution. We argue that the proposed regression method is well suited to the task of causal inference in additive noise models. A practical disadvantage is that the resulting optimization problem is generally non-convex and can be difficult to solve. Nev-ertheless, we report good results on one of the tasks of the NIPS 2008 Causality Challenge, where the goal is to distinguish causes from effects in pairs of statistically dependent vari-ables. In addition, we propose an algorithm for efficiently inferring causal models from observational data for more than two vari-ables. The required number of regressions and independence tests is quadratic in the number of variables, which is a significant im-provement over the simple method that tests all possible DAGs.},

These include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and similar tranched credit products, and “n-th to default swaps.” Devising good default risk models for single-name credits has been challenging enough, but applying them to credit portfolios introduces much greater complexity, because of the critical importance of correlation. The most common valuation technology is Monte Carlo simulation, but with many bonds, each of which is subject to both correlated and idiosyncratic risk factors, the simulation is time-consuming and limited in scope. In this article, Hull and White offer two straightforward approximation techniques for evaluating default risk within the industry-standard “copula“ model that eliminate simulation of the idiosyncratic risks. Their approach greatly accelerates the solution while still allowing a large degree of flexibility in the choice of factor correlation structure and probability distributions. For example, Student-t distributed shocks that have fatter tails than the normal are easily accommodated.},

We then generalize our result to the mixed categorical and continuous regressor case which is frequently encountered in applied settings. Monte Carlo simulation results are reported to examine the finite sample performance of the local-linear based cross-validation smoothing parameter selector. We relate the theoretical and simulation results to a corrected AIC method (termed AICc) proposed by Hurvich, Simonoff and Tsai (1998) and find that AICc has impressive finite-sample properties.},

  abstract      = {Machine learning is the science of discovering statistical dependencies in data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human performance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and computer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning avoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way forward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms. Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships between the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide understanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen environments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer "what if" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under hypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and effect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice. This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways. First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification, yielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover causal structures in convolutional neural network features using our algorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of real-world benchmarks.},

It introduces a random variable called {\textquotedblleft}time-until-default{\textquotedblright} to denote the survival time of each defaultable entity or financial instrument, and defines the default correlation between two credit risks as the correlation coefficient between their survival times. The author explains why a copula function approach should be used to specify the joint distribution of survival times after marginal distributions of survival times are derived from market information, such as risky bond prices or asset swap spreads. He shows that the current approach to default correlation through asset correlation is equivalent to using a normal copula function. Numerical examples illustrate the use of copula functions in the valuation of some credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps and first-to-default contracts.},

The EMD has already shown its usefulness in a wide range of applications including meteorology, structural stability analysis, medical studies. On the other hand, the EMD algorithm contains heuristic and ad hoc elements that make it hard to analyze mathematically. In this paper we describe a method that captures the flavor and philosophy of the EMD approach, albeit using a different approach in constructing the components. The proposed method is a combination of wavelet analysis and reallocation method. We introduce a precise mathematical definition for a class of functions that can be viewed as a superposition of a reasonably small number of approximately harmonic components, and we prove that our method does indeed succeed in decomposing arbitrary functions in this class. We provide several examples, for simulated as well as real data.},

The class of d-dimensional Archimedean copulas is shown to coincide with the class of survival copulas of d-dimensional 1-norm symmetric distributions that place no point mass at the origin. The d-monotone Archimedean copula generators may be characterized using a little-known integral transform of Williamson [Duke Math. J. 23 (1956) 189-207] in an analogous manner to the well-known Bernstein-Widder characterization of completely monotone generators in terms of the Laplace transform. These insights allow the construction of new Archimedean copula families and provide a general solution to the problem of sampling multivariate Archimedean copulas. They also yield useful expressions for the d-dimensional Kendall function and Kendall's rank correlation coefficients and facilitate the derivation of results on the existence of densities and the description of singular components for Archimedean copulas. The existence of a sharp lower bound for Archimedean copulas with respect to the positive lower orthant dependence ordering is shown.},

The methodology is applied to a case study which uses data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and whose aim is to estimate the effect of private health insurance on health care utilization. Unobserved confounding arises when variables which are associated with both treatment and outcome are not available (in economics this issue is known as endogeneity). Also, treatment and outcome may exhibit a dependence which cannot be modeled using a linear measure of association, and observed confounders may have a non-linear impact on the treatment and outcome variables. The problem of unobserved confounding is addressed using a two-equation structural latent variable framework, where one equation essentially describes a binary outcome as a function of a binary treatment whereas the other equation determines whether the treatment is received. Non-linear dependence between treatment and outcome is dealt using copula functions, whereas covariate-response relationships are flexibly modeled using a spline approach. Related model fitting and inferential procedures are developed, and asymptotic arguments presented.},

In particular, we assume access to a collection $\{(S_i,l_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where each $S_i$ is a sample drawn from the probability distribution of $X_i \times Y_i$, and $l_i$ is a binary label indicating whether "$X_i \to Y_i$" or "$X_i \leftarrow Y_i$". Given these data, we build a causal inference rule in two steps. First, we featurize each $S_i$ using the kernel mean embedding associated with some characteristic kernel. Second, we train a binary classifier on such embeddings to distinguish between causal directions. We present generalization bounds showing the statistical consistency and learning rates of the proposed approach, and provide a simple implementation that achieves state-of-the-art cause-effect inference. Furthermore, we extend our ideas to infer causal relationships between more than two variables.},

  abstract  = {Often researchers find parametric models restrictive and sensitive to deviations from the parametric specifications; semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead to other complications such as introducing infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that may not be compact and the optimization problem may no longer be well-posed. The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results.},

The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton-Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

abstract = {Adistribution is conditionally specifiedwhen its model constraints are expressed conditionally. For example, Besag's (1974) spatial model was specified conditioned on the neighbouring states, and pseudolikelihood is intended to approximate the likelihood using conditional likelihoods. There are three issues of interest: existence, uniqueness and computation of a joint distribution. In the literature, most results and proofs are for discrete probabilities; here we exclusively study distributions with continuous state space.We examine all three issues using the dependence func- tions derived from decomposition of the conditional densities.We show that certain dependence functions of the joint density are shared with its conditional densities. Therefore, two conditional densities involving the same set of variables are compatible if their overlapping dependence func- tions are identical.We prove that the joint density is uniquewhen the set of dependence functions is both compatible and complete. In addition, a joint density, apart from a constant, can be com- puted from the dependence functions in closed form. Since all of the results are expressed in terms of dependence functions, we consider our approach to be dependence-based, whereas methods in the literature are generally density-based. Applications of the dependence-based formulation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract An automated homogenization algorithm based on the pairwise comparison of monthly temperature series is described. The algorithm works by forming pairwise difference series between serial monthly temperature values from a network of observing stations. Each difference series is then evaluated for undocumented shifts, and the station series responsible for such breaks is identified automatically. The algorithm also makes use of station history information, when available, to improve the identification of artificial shifts in temperature data. In addition, an evaluation is carried out to distinguish trend inhomogeneities from abrupt shifts. When the magnitude of an apparent shift attributed to a particular station can be reliably estimated, an adjustment is made for the target series. The pairwise algorithm is shown to be robust and efficient at detecting undocumented step changes under a variety of simulated scenarios with step- and trend-type inhomogeneities. Moreover, the approach is shown to yi...},

We describe popular classes of semi-nonparametric dynamic models and some temporal dependence properties. We then present penalized sieve extremum (PSE) estimation as a general method for semi-nonparametric models with cross-sectional, panel, time series, or spatial data. The method is especially powerful in estimating difficult ill-posed inverse problems such as semi-nonparametric mixtures or conditional moment restrictions. We review recent advances on inference and large sample properties of the PSE estimators, which include (1) consistency and convergence rates of the PSE estimator of the nonparametric part; (2) limiting distributions of plug-in PSE estimators of functionals that are either smooth (i.e., root-n estimable) or non-smooth (i.e., slower than root-n estimable); (3) simple criterion-based inference for plug-in PSE estimation of smooth or non-smooth functionals; and (4) root-n asymptotic normality of semiparametric two-step estimators and their consistent variance estimators. Examples from dynamic asset pricing, nonlinear spatial VAR, semiparametric GARCH, and copula-based multivariate financial models are used to illustrate the general results.},

Current sequential greedy approaches for structure selection require calculating spanning trees in hundreds of dimensions and fitting the pair copulas and their parameters iteratively throughout the structure selection process. Our method uses a connection between the vine and structural equation models (SEMs). The later can be estimated very fast using the Lasso, also in very high dimensions, to obtain sparse models. Thus, we obtain a structure estimate independently of the chosen pair copulas and parameters. Additionally, we define the novel concept of regularization paths for R-vine matrices. It relates sparsity of the vine copula model in terms of independence copulas to a penalization coefficient in the structural equation models. We illustrate our approach and provide many numerical examples. These include simulations and data applications in high dimensions, showing the superiority of our approach to other existing methods.},

abstract = {Although many algorithms have been designed to construct Bayesian network struc- tures using different approaches and principles, they all employ only two methods: those based on independence criteria, and those based on a scoring function and a search pro- cedure (although some methods combine the two). Within the score+search paradigm, the dominant approach uses local search methods in the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the usual choices for defining the elementary modifications (local changes) that can be applied are arc addition, arc deletion, and arc reversal. In this paper, we propose a new local search method that uses a different search space, and which takes account of the concept of equivalence between network structures: restricted acyclic par- tially directed graphs (RPDAGs). In this way, the number of different configurations of the search space is reduced, thus improving efficiency. Moreover, although the final result must necessarily be a local optimum given the nature of the search method, the topology of the new search space, which avoids making early decisions about the directions of the arcs, may help to find better local optima than those obtained by searching in the DAG space. Detailed results of the evaluation of the proposed search method on several test problems, including the well-known Alarm Monitoring System, are also presented.},

MuBreD is based on a comparison of the estimated spectral distribution on different segments of the observed time series and consists of three steps: it starts with a consistent test, which allows us to prove the existence of structural breaks at a controlled Type I error. Second, it estimates sets containing possible break points and finally these sets are reduced to identify the relevant structural breaks and corresponding components which are responsible for the changes in the autocovariance structure. In contrast to all other methods proposed in the literature, our approach does not make any parametric assumptions, is not especially designed for detecting one single change point, and addresses the problem of multiple structural breaks in the autocovariance function directly with no use of the binary segmentation algorithm. We prove that the new procedure detects all components and the corresponding locations where structural breaks occur with probability converging to one as the sample size increases and provide data-driven rules for the selection of all regularization parameters. The results are illustrated by analyzing financial asset returns, and in a simulation study it is demonstrated that MuBreD outperforms the currently available nonparametric methods for detecting breaks in the dependency structure of multivariate time series.

  abstract = {Causality is a fundamental notion in science, and plays an important role in explanation, prediction, decision making, and control. Recently, with the rapid accumulation of huge vol-umes of data, it is even more desirable to abstract causal knowledge from data. Furthermore, such data are usually time series measured over a relatively long time period or aggregated data from multiple data sets collected in different environments or under different experi-mental conditions, leading to the issue of data heterogeneity. Causality also provides a way to understand and tackle data heterogeneity, while traditional machine learning typically assumes that the given data follow a fixed distribution. A traditional way to discover causal relations is to use interventions or randomized ex-periments, which is in many cases too expensive, too time-consuming, or even impossible. Therefore, revealing causal information by analyzing purely observational data, known as causal discovery, has drawn much attention [1]. Past decades have seen a series of cross-disciplinary advances in algorithms for identifying causal relations and effect sizes from observational data or mixed experimental and observational data. These developments promise to enable better use of appropriate " big data. " They have already been applied in genomics, ecology, epidemiology, space physics, clinical medicine, neuroscience, and many other domains, often with experimental or quasi-experimental validation of their predictions. Causal discovery will be a main focus of this perspective. In traditional causality research, algorithms for identification of causal effects, or inferences about the effects of interventions, when the causal relations are completely or partially known, address a different class of prob-lems; see [2] and references therein. Moreover, causal models provide compact descriptions of the properties of data distributions, and it has recently been demonstrated that causal knowledge can facilitate various machine learning tasks, including semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation (or transfer learning).},

The new framework incorporates Box?Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself.},

In terms of standard measures of dependence, we express conditions under which a specific pair-copula decomposition of a multivariate distribution is of this simplified form.

The key idea of this approach is to rewrite the characterization of a regression quantile in terms of a copula and marginal distributions. After the copula and the marginal distributions are estimated, the new estimator is obtained as the weighted quantile of the response variable in the model. The proposed conditional estimator has three main advantages: it applies to both iid and time series data, it is automatically monotonic across quantiles, and, unlike other copula-based methods, it can be directly applied to the multiple covariates case without introducing any extra complications. We show the asymptotic properties of our estimator when the copula is estimated by maximizing the pseudo-log-likelihood and the margins are estimated nonparametrically including the case where the copula family is misspecified. We also present the finite sample performance of the estimator and illustrate the usefulness of our proposal by an application to the historical volatilities of Google and Yahoo.},

Through the minimum description length principle, we link the postulate of independence between the generating mechanisms of the cause and of the effect given the cause to quantile regression. Based on this theory, we develop Bivariate Quantile Causal Discovery (bQCD), a new method to distinguish cause from effect assuming no confounding, selection bias or feedback. Because it uses multiple quantile levels instead of the conditional mean only, bQCD is adaptive not only to additive, but also to multiplicative or even location-scale generating mechanisms. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform an extensive empirical comparison on both synthetic and real datasets. This study shows that bQCD is robust across different implementations of the method (i.e., the quantile regression), computationally efficient, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods.},

Our approach combines pseudo-maximum-likelihood fitting of GARCH models to estimate the current volatility and extreme value theory (EVT) for estimating the tail of the innovation distribution of the GARCH model. We use our method to estimate conditional quantiles (VaR) and conditional expected shortfalls (the expected size of a return exceeding VaR), this being an alternative measure of tail risk with better theoretical properties than the quantile. Using backtesting of historical daily return series we show that our procedure gives better 1-day estimates than methods which ignore the heavy tails of the innovations or the stochastic nature of the volatility. With the help of our fitted models we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to estimating the conditional quantiles of returns over multiple-day horizons and find that this outperforms the simple square-root-of-time scaling method.},

In this book Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of Bayes networks, with results that have been applied in diverse areas of research in the social, behavioral, and physical sciences.The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences, they are subject to uniform principles. They axiomatize the connection between causal structure and probabilistic independence, explore several varieties of causal indistinguishability, formulate a theory of manipulation, and develop asymptotically reliable procedures for searching over equivalence classes of causal models, including models of categorical data and structural equation models with and without latent variables.The authors show that the relationship between causality and probability can also help to clarify such diverse topics in statistics as the comparative power of experimentation versus observation, Simpson's paradox, errors in regression models, retrospective versus prospective sampling, and variable selection.The second edition contains a new introduction and an extensive survey of advances and applications that have appeared since the first edition was published in 1993.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. GARCH models have been applied in modelling the relation between conditional variance and asset risk premia. These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.

  abstract = {Financial asset prices occasionally exhibit large changes. To deal with their occurrence, observed return series are assumed to consist of a conditionally Gaussian ARMA–GARCH type model contaminated by an additive jump component. In this framework, a new test for additive jumps is proposed. The test is based on standardized returns, where the first two conditional moments of the non-contaminated observations are estimated in a robust way. Simulation results indicate that the test has very good finite sample properties, i.e. correct size and high proportion of correct jump detection. The test is applied to daily returns and detects less than 1% of jumps for three exchange rates and between 1% and 3% of jumps for about 50 large capitalization stock returns from the NYSE. Once jumps have been filtered out, all series are found to be conditionally Gaussian. It is also found that simple GARCH-type models estimated using filtered returns deliver more accurate out-of sample forecasts of the conditional variance than GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) models estimated from raw data.},

Methods of statistical analysis for lattice schemes are proposed, including a very flexible coding technique. The methods are illustrated by two numerical examples.

In contrast to previously developed tests, a wide variety of accuracy measures can be used (in particular, the loss of function need not be quadratic and need not even be symmetric), and forecast errors can be non-Gaussian, nonzero mean, serially correlated, and contemporaneously correlated. Asymptotic and exact finite-sample tests are proposed, evaluated, and illustrated.},

We decompose volatility of high-frequency returns into components that may be easily interpreted and estimated. The conditional variance is a product of daily, diurnal, and stochastic intraday components. This model is applied to a comprehensive sample consisting of 10-minute returns on more than 2500 US equities. Apart from building a new model, we obtain several interesting forecasting results. We apply a number of different specifications. We estimate models for separate companies, pool data into industries, and consider other criteria for grouping returns. In general, forecasts from pooled cross-section of companies outperform the corresponding forecasts from company-by-company estimation. For less liquid stocks, however, we obtain better forecasts when we group less frequently traded companies together.},

Assuming that the causes and the effects have the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the residuals of a linear fit in the anticausal direction is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized by reduction of the magnitude of the highorder cumulants and by an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The problem of nonlinear causal inference is addressed by performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures of Gaussianity. The proposed method is shown to be competitive with stateoftheart techniques for causal inference.},

The edges of the graph reflect allowed conditional dependencies among the variables. Graphical models admit computationally convenient factorization properties and have long been a valuable tool for tractable modeling of multivariate distributions. More recently, applications such as reconstructing gene regulatory networks from gene expression data have driven major advances in structure learning, that is, estimating the graph underlying a model. We review some of these advances and discuss methods such as the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection for undirected graphical models (or Markov random fields), and the PC algorithm and score-based search methods for directed graphical models (or Bayesian networks). We further review extensions that account for effects of latent variables and heterogeneous data sources.},

Different graphs may result in different causal inference statements and different intervention distributions. To quantify such differences, we propose a (pre-) distance between DAGs, the structural intervention distance (SID). The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well-suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially directed acyclic graphs that represent Markov equivalence classes. Since it differs significantly from the popular Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), the SID constitutes a valuable additional measure. We discuss properties of this distance and provide an efficient implementation with software code available on the first author's homepage (an R package is under construction).},

  abstract = {This paper presents two new models of portfolio default loss that extend the standard Gaussian copula model yet preserve tractability and com- putational efficiency. In one extension, we randomize recovery rates, explicitly allowing for the empirically well-established effect of inverse correlation between recovery rates and default frequencies. In another extension, we build into the model random systematic factor loadings, effectively allowing default correlations to be higher in bear markets than in bull markets. In both extensions, special cases of the models are shown to be as tractable as the Gaussian copula model and to allow efficient calibration to market credit spreads. We demonstrate that the models – even in their simplest versions – can generate highly significant pricing effects such as fat tails and a correlation “skew” in synthetic CDO tranche prices. When properly calibrated, the skew effect of random recovery is quite minor, but the extension with random factor loadings can produce correlation skews similar to the steep skews observed in the market. We briefly discuss two alternative skew models, one based on the Marshall- Olkin copula, the other on a spread-dependent correlation specification for the Gaussian copula.},

Instrumental in most of these empirical studies has been the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model introduced by Engle (1982). This paper contains an overview of some of the developments in the formulation of ARCH models and a survey of the numerous empirical applications using financial data. Several suggestions for future research, including the implementation and tests of competing asset pricing theories, market microstructure models, information transmission mechanisms, dynamic hedging strategies, and the pricing of derivative assets, are also discussed.},

Describing the influence of dependence in multivariate stochastic models on risk vectors is the main focus of the text that presents main ideas and methods as well as their relevance to practical applications. The first part introduces basic probabilistic tools and methods of distributional analysis, and describes their use to the modeling of dependence and to the derivation of risk bounds in these models. In the second, part risk measures with a particular focus on those in the financial and insurance context are presented. The final parts are then devoted to applications relevant to optimal risk allocation, optimal portfolio problems as well as to the optimization of insurance contracts. Good knowledge of basic probability and statistics as well as of basic general mathematics is a prerequisite for comfortably reading and working with the present volume, which is intended for graduate students, practitioners and researchers and can serve as a reference resource for the main concepts and techniques.},

It is assumed that the observations follow a one-parameter exponential family of distributions given an accompanying process that evolves as a function of lagged observations. We employ an iterated random function approach and a special coupling technique to show that, under suitable conditions on the parameter space, the conditional mean process is a geometric moment contracting Markov chain and that the observation process is absolutely regular with geometrically decaying coefficients. Asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters is established under some mild assumptions. These models are applied to two examples; the first is the number of transactions per minute of Ericsson stock and the second is related to return times of extreme events of Goldman Sachs Group stock.},

  abstract  = {A statistical functional, such as the mean or the median, is called elicitable if there is a scoring function or loss function such that the correct forecast of the functional is the unique minimizer of the expected score. Such scoring functions are called strictly consistent for the functional. The elicitability of a functional opens the possibility to compare competing forecasts and to rank them in terms of their realized scores. In this paper, we explore the notion of elicitability for multi-dimensional functionals and give both necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly consistent scoring functions. We cover the case of functionals with elicitable components, but we also show that one-dimensional functionals that are not elicitable can be a component of a higher order elicitable functional. In the case of the variance, this is a known result. However, an important result of this paper is that spectral risk measures with a spectral measure with finite support are jointly elicitable if one adds the "correct" quantiles. A direct consequence of applied interest is that the pair (Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall) is jointly elicitable under mild conditions that are usually fulfilled in risk management applications.},

  abstract      = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The dependence structure of max-stable random vectors can be characterized by their Pickands dependence function. In many applications, the extremal dependence measure varies with covariates. We develop a flexible, semi-parametric method for the estimation of non-stationary multivariate Pickands dependence functions. The proposed construction is based on an accurate max-projection allowing to pass from the multivariate to the univariate setting and to rely on the generalized additive modeling framework. In the bivariate case, the resulting estimator of the Pickands function is regularized using constrained median smoothing B-splines, and bootstrap variability bands are constructed. In higher dimensions, we tailor our approach to the estimation of the extremal coefficient. An extended simulation study suggests that our estimator performs well and is competitive with the standard estimators in the absence of covariates. We apply the new methodology to a temperature dataset in the US where the extremal dependence is linked to time and altitude.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in random forest models which are recognized to exhibit good practical performance, especially in high-dimensional settings. On the theoretical side, however, their predictive power remains largely unexplained, thereby creating a gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we present some asymptotic results on random forests in a regression framework. Firstly, we provide theoretical guarantees to link finite forests used in practice (with a finite number M of trees) to their asymptotic counterparts (with M=∞). Using empirical process theory, we prove a uniform central limit theorem for a large class of random forest estimates, which holds in particular for Breiman's (2001) original forests. Secondly, we show that infinite forest consistency implies finite forest consistency and thus, we state the consistency of several infinite forests. In particular, we prove that q quantile forests–close in spirit to Breiman's (2001) forests but easier to study–are able to combine inconsistent trees to obtain a final consistent prediction, thus highlighting the benefits of random forests compared to single trees.},

  abstract  = {We develop a general theory which provides a unified treatment for the asymptotic normality and efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) in parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric models. We find that the asymptotic behavior of substitution estimates for estimating smooth functionals are essentially governed by two indices: the degree of smoothness of the functional and the local size of the underlying parameter space. We show that when the local size of the parameter space is not very large, the substitution standard (nonsieve), substitution sieve and substitution penalized MLE's are asymptotically efficient in the Fisher sense, under certain stochastic equicontinuity conditions of the log-likelihood. Moreover, when the convergence rate of the estimate is slow, the degree of smoothness of the functional needs to compensate for the slowness of the rate in order to achieve efficiency. When the size of the parameter space is very large, the standard and penalized maximum likelihood procedures may be inefficient, whereas the method of sieves may be able to overcome this difficulty. This phenomenon is particularly manifested when the functional of interest is very smooth, especially in the semiparametric case. CR - Copyright &#169; 1997 Institute of Mathematical Statistics},

For applications one usually makes the simplifying assumption that copulas of conditional distributions are independent of the variables on which they are conditioned. However this assumption has been criticised for being too restrictive. We examine both simplified and non-simplified vine copulas in three dimensions and investigate conceptual differences. We show and compare contour surfaces of three-dimensional vine copula models, which prove to be much more informative than the contour lines of the bivariate marginals. Our investigation shows that non-simplified vine copulas can exhibit arbitrarily irregular shapes, whereas simplified vine copulas appear to be smooth extrapolations of their bivariate margins to three dimensions. In addition to a variety of constructed examples, we also investigate a three-dimensional subset of the well-known uranium data set and visually detect that a non-simplified vine copula is necessary to capture its complex dependence structure.},

Increased tail dependence and asymmetry characterize the Asian countries, while symmetry and tail independence describe the Latin American case. Structural breaks in tail dependence are a dimension of the contagion phenomenon. Therefore, the rejection of the correlation breakdown hypothesis should not be considered, without further investigation, as evidence of a stable dependence structure.},

Consequently, there have been many empirical studies to evaluate the performance of different techniques endeavouring to accomplish this effectively. However no one technique dominates and so designing a reliable defect prediction model remains problematic. Objective. We seek to make sense of the many conflicting experimental results and understand which factors have the largest effect onpredictive performance. Method. We conduct a meta-analysis of all relevant, high quality primary studies of defect prediction to determine what factors influence predictive performance. This is based on 42 primary studies that satisfy our inclusion criteria that collectively report 600 sets of empirical prediction results. By reverse engineering a common response variable we build arandom effects ANOVA model to examine the relative contribution of four model building factors (classifier, data set, input metrics and researcher group) to model prediction performance. Results. Surprisingly we find that the choice of classifier has little impact upon performance (1.3 percent) and in contrast the major (31 percent) explanatory factor is the researcher group. It matters more who does the work than what is done. Conclusion. To overcome this high level of researcher bias, defect prediction researchers should (i) conduct blind analysis, (ii) improve reporting protocols and (iii) conduct more intergroup studies in order to alleviate expertise issues. Lastly, research is required to determine whether this bias is prevalent in other applications domains.},

This approach is attractive when the likelihood of the copula model is not known in closed form, or when the researcher has a set of dependence measures or other functionals of the copula that are of particular interest. The proposed approach naturally also nests MM and generalized method of moments estimators. Drawing on results for simulation-based estimation and on recent work in empirical copula process theory, we show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator, and obtain a simple test of overidentifying restrictions as a specification test. The results apply to both iid and time series data. We analyze the finite-sample behavior of these estimators in an extensive simulation study. We apply the model to a group of seven financial stock returns and find evidence of statistically significant tail dependence, and mild evidence that the dependence between these assets is stronger in crashes than booms.

  abstract      = {We introduce a new approach to functional causal modeling from observational data. The approach, called Causal Generative Neural Networks (CGNN), leverages the power of neural networks to learn a generative model of the joint distribution of the observed variables, by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between generated and observed data. An approximate learning criterion is proposed to scale the computational cost of the approach to linear complexity in the number of observations. The performance of CGNN is studied throughout three experiments. First, we apply CGNN to the problem of cause-effect inference, where two CGNNs model $P(Y|X,\textrm{noise})$ and $P(X|Y,\textrm{noise})$ identify the best causal hypothesis out of $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\rightarrow X$. Second, CGNN is applied to the problem of identifying v-structures and conditional independences. Third, we apply CGNN to problem of multivariate functional causal modeling: given a skeleton describing the dependences in a set of random variables $\{X_1, \ldots, X_d\}$, CGNN orients the edges in the skeleton to uncover the directed acyclic causal graph describing the causal structure of the random variables. On all three tasks, CGNN is extensively assessed on both artificial and real-world data, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art. Finally, we extend CGNN to handle the case of confounders, where latent variables are involved in the overall causal model.},

  year     = {2017},
  abstract = {—The algorithmic Markov condition states that the most likely causal direction between two random variables X and Y can be identified as the direction with the lowest Kolmogorov complexity. This notion is very powerful as it can detect any causal dependency that can be explained by a physical process. However, due to the halting problem, it is also not computable. In this paper we propose an computable instantiation that provably maintains the key aspects of the ideal. We propose to ap-proximate Kolmogorov complexity via the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using a score that is mini-max optimal with regard to the model class under consideration. This means that even in an adversarial setting, the score degrades gracefully, and we are still maximally able to detect dependencies between the marginal and the conditional distribution. As a proof of concept, we propose CISC, a linear-time algo-rithm for causal inference by stochastic complexity, for pairs of univariate discrete variables. Experiments show that CISC is highly accurate on synthetic, benchmark, as well as real-world data, outperforming the state of the art by a margin, and scales extremely well with regard to sample and domain sizes.},

  abstract  = {This article reviews the principle of minimum description length (MDL) for problems of model selection. By viewing statistical modeling as a means of generating descriptions of observed data, the MDL framework discriminates between competing models based on the complexity of each description. This approach began with Kolmogorov's theory of algorithmic complexity, matured in the literature on information theory, and has recently received renewed attention within the statistics community. Here we review both the practical and the theoretical aspects of MDL as a tool for model selection, emphasizing the rich connections between information theory and statistics. At the boundary between these two disciplines we find many interesting interpretations of popular frequentist and Bayesian procedures. As we show, MDL provides an objective umbrella under which rather disparate approaches to statistical modeling can coexist and be compared. We illustrate the MDL principle by considering problems in regression, nonparametric curve estimation, cluster analysis, and time series analysis. Because model selection in linear regression is an extremely common problem that arises in many applications, we present detailed derivations of several MDL criteria in this context and discuss their properties through a number of examples. Our emphasis is on the practical application of MDL, and hence we make extensive use of real datasets. In writing this review, we tried to make the descriptive philosophy of MDL natural to a statistics audience by examining classical problems in model selection. In the engineering literature, however, MDL is being applied to ever more exotic modeling situations. As a principle for statistical modeling in general, one strength of MDL is that it can be intuitively extended to provide useful tools for new problems.},

We propose using approximate Bayes factors to assess the improvement in fit over a GLM with canonical link when a parametric link family is used. The approximate Bayes factors are calculated using the Laplace approximations given in [32], together with a reference set of prior distributions. This methodology can be used to differentiate between different parametric link families, as well as allowing one to jointly select the link family and the independent variables. This involves comparing nonnested models and so standard significance tests cannot be used. The approach also accounts explicitly for uncertainty about the link function. The methods are illustrated using parametric link families studied in [12] for two data sets involving binomial responses.},

Most previous work assumed that the variables are multivariate Gaussian or that the conditional means of the variables are linearly related. Unfortunately, if these assumptions are violated, the resulting conditional independence estimates can be inaccurate. We propose a semiparametric method, graph estimation with joint additive models, which allows the conditional means of the features to take an arbitrary additive form. We present an efficient algorithm for computation of our estimator, and prove that it is consistent. We extend our method to estimation of directed graphs with known causal ordering. Using simulated data, we show that our method performs better than existing methods when there are nonlinear relationships among the features, and is comparable to methods that assume multivariate normality when the conditional means are linear. We illustrate our method on a cell signalling dataset.},

  abstract = {While most regression models focus on explaining distributional aspects of one single response variable alone, interest in modern statistical applications has recently shifted towards simultaneously studying multiple response variables as well as their dependence structure. A particularly useful tool for pursuing such an analysis are copula-based regression models since they enable the separation of the marginal response distributions and the dependence structure summarised in a specific copula model. However, so far copula-based regression models have mostly been relying on two-step approaches where the marginal distributions are determined first whereas the copula structure is studied in a second step after plugging in the estimated marginal distributions. Moreover, the parameters of the copula are mostly treated as a constant not related to covariates and most regression specifications for the marginals are restricted to purely linear predictors. We therefore propose simultaneous Bayesian inference for both the marginal distributions and the copula using computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. In addition, we replace the commonly used linear predictor by a generic structured additive predictor comprising for example nonlinear effects of continuous covariates, spatial effects or random effects and furthermore allow to make the copula parameters covariate-dependent. To facilitate Bayesian inference, we construct proposal densities for a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm relying on quadratic approximations to the full conditionals of regression coefficients avoiding manual tuning. The performance of the resulting Bayesian estimates is evaluated in simulations comparing our approach with penalised likelihood inference, studying the choice of a specific copula model based on the deviance information criterion, and comparing a simultaneous approach with a two-step procedure. Furthermore, the flexibility of Bayesian conditional copula regression models is illustrated in two applications on childhood undernutrition and macroecology.},

For example, can we have a density estimator whose definite integrals are efficient estimators of the cumulative distribution function? We show that this is impossible for very large sets, for example, expectations of all functions bounded by M<∞. However, we also show that it is possible for sets as large as indicators of all quadrants, that is, distribution functions. We give appropriate constructions of such estimates.},

  abstract      = {Typically, point forecasting methods are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function, such as the absolute error or the squared error. The individual scores are then averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the (root) mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.},

The proposed models are particularly attractive for relatively high dimensional applications, involving fifty or more variables, and can be combined with semiparametric marginal distributions to obtain flexible multivariate distributions. Factor copulas generally lack a closed-form density, but we obtain analytical results for the implied tail dependence using extreme value theory, and we verify that simulation-based estimation using rank statistics is reliable even in high dimensions. We consider ?scree? plots to aid the choice of the number of factors in the model. The model is applied to daily returns on all 100 constituents of the S&P 100 index, and we find significant evidence of tail dependence, heterogeneous dependence, and asymmetric dependence, with dependence being stronger in crashes than in booms. We also show that factor copula models provide superior estimates of some measures of systemic risk.},

  abstract  = {We consider a bivariate regression model in which the error structure is arbitrary, except for equality of its marginal distributions. Two simple but inefficient approaches to analysis are (i) to work with the differences between the two components of each response and (ii) to derive working independence estimators as if the two component responses were independent. The former strategy does well if the explanatory variables are balanced over pairs and the correlation between the two components of the response is high; the latter strategy does well when the response correlation is low or the covariates are highly unbalanced. We show that combining the two estimators can give a procedure with high efficiency in all situations. We show that an adjusted marginal score can be calculated that is uncorrelated with the within-pair score, so that separate intrapair and interpair estimators can be calculated. For bivariate normal regression models our approach is identical to the usual procedure for combining intra- and interblock information. In general the approaches are not the same. Detailed calculations and a numerical example are given for a bivariate extreme value model due to Gumbel that is also important in survival analysis. Extensions from bivariate to general multivariate responses are indicated.},

Flexible Bayesian inference for the calibration function of a bivariate conditional copula is proposed via a sparse Gaussian process (GP) prior distribution over the set of smooth calibration functions for the single index model (SIM). The estimation of parameters from the marginal distributions and the calibration function is done jointly via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from the full posterior distribution. A new Conditional Cross Validated Pseudo-Marginal (CCVML) criterion is introduced in order to perform copula selection and is modified using a permutation-based procedure to assess data support for the simplifying assumption. The performance of the estimation method and model selection criteria is studied via a series of simulations using correct and misspecified models with Clayton, Frank and Gaussian copulas and a numerical application involving red wine features.},

If the marginal distribution functions are unknown and are replaced by their empirical estimates, then the test's properties change significantly. This is shown in detail by simulation for special cases. A bootstrap version of the test is suggested and it is shown by simulation that it performs well. An empirical application of this test to daily returns of German assets reveals that a Gaussian copula is unsuitable to describe their dependence structure. A t$\nu$-copula with low degrees of freedom such as $\nu$=4 or 5 fits the data in some cases.},

abstract = {We consider structural equation models in which variables can be written as a function of their parents and noise terms, which are assumed to be jointly independent. Corresponding to each structural equation model, there is a directed acyclic graph describing the relationships between the variables. In Gaussian structural equation models with linear functions, the graph can be identified from the joint distribution only up to Markov equivalence classes, assuming faithfulness. In this work, we prove full identifiability if all noise variables have the same variances: the directed acyclic graph can be recovered from the joint Gaussian distribution. Our result has direct implications for causal inference: if the data follow a Gaussian structural equation model with equal error variances and assuming that all variables are observed, the causal structure can be inferred from observational data only. We propose a statistical method and an algorithm that exploit our theoretical findings.},

We show that all currently used latent variable models can be mapped into equivalent mixture models, which facilitates their simulation, statistical fitting and the study of their large portfolio properties.

When sampled probabilistically, these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce randomness in the observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with our theoretical formulation. Finally, we evaluate this new algorithm on the Atari 2600 games, observing that it significantly outperforms many of the recent improvements on DQN, including the related distributional algorithm C51.},

To this end, we extend the theorems proved by Ne{\v{s}}lehov{\'{a}} (2007) from bivariate to multivariate copulas with discrete and continuous marginal distributions. Using the multivariate copula with discrete and continuous marginal distributions as a theoretical basis, we construct an HCBN that can model all possible permutations of discrete and continuous random variables for parent and child nodes, unlike the popular conditional linear Gaussian network model. Finally, we demon-strate on a numerous synthetic datasets and a real life dataset that our HCBN compares favorably, from a modeling and flexibility viewpoint, to other hybrid models including the conditional linear Gaussian and the mixture of truncated exponentials models.},

  abstract  = {Discrete vine copulas provide a flexible modeling framework for high-dimensional data and have significant computational advantages over competing methods. A vine-based multivariate probability mass function is constructed from bivariate copula building blocks and univariate marginal distributions. However, even for a moderate number of variables, the number of alternative vine decompositions is very large and additionally there is a large set of candidate bivariate copula families that can be used as building blocks in any given decomposition. Together, these two issues ensure that it is infeasible to evaluate all possible vine copula models. Instead, two greedy algorithms for automatically selecting vine structures and component pair-copula building blocks are introduced. The algorithms are tested in a simulation study that is itself driven by real world data from online retail. Both algorithms select vines that provide accurate estimates of the joint probabilities. Using three different f-divergences as criteria, the proposed algorithms outperform a Gaussian copula benchmark, especially for data with high dependence. Finally, the selection algorithm is applied to data from the General Social Survey and outperforms a Gaussian copula benchmark using both in-sample and out-of-sample criteria.},

  abstract  = {While conventional approaches to causal inference are mainly based on conditional (in)dependences, recent methods also account for the shape of (conditional) distributions. The idea is that the causal hypothesis "X causes Y" imposes that the marginal distribution PX and the conditional distribution PY| X represent independent mechanisms of nature. Recently it has been postulated that the shortest description of the joint distribution PX, Y should therefore be given by separate descriptions of PX and PY| X. Since description length in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable, practical implementations rely on other notions of independence. Here we define independence via orthogonality in information space. This way, we can explicitly describe the kind of dependence that occurs between PY and PX| Y making the causal hypothesis "Y causes X" implausible. Remarkably, this asymmetry between cause and effect becomes particularly simple if X and Y are deterministically related. We present an inference method that works in this case. We also discuss some theoretical results for the non-deterministic case although it is not clear how to employ them for a more general inference method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Regular vine distributions which constitute a flexible class of multivariate dependence models are discussed. Since multivariate copulae constructed through pair-copula decompositions were introduced to the statistical community, interest in these models has been growing steadily and they are finding successful applications in various fields. Research so far has however been concentrating on so-called canonical and D-vine copulae, which are more restrictive cases of regular vine copulae. It is shown how to evaluate the density of arbitrary regular vine specifications. This opens the vine copula methodology to the flexible modeling of complex dependencies even in larger dimensions. In this regard, a new automated model selection and estimation technique based on graph theoretical considerations is presented. This comprehensive search strategy is evaluated in a large simulation study and applied to a 16-dimensional financial data set of international equity, fixed income and commodity indices which were observed over the last decade, in particular during the recent financial crisis. The analysis provides economically well interpretable results and interesting insights into the dependence structure among these indices.},

We develop Bayesian inference for a recently proposed latent factor copula model, which utilizes a pair copula construction to couple the variables with the latent factor. We use adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (ARMS) within Gibbs sampling for posterior simulation: Gibbs sampling enables application to Bayesian problems, while ARMS is an adaptive strategy that replaces traditional Metropolis-Hastings updates, which typically require careful tuning. Our simulation study shows favorable performance of our proposed approach both in terms of sampling efficiency and accuracy.

In particular, we use causal models to represent the relationship between the features X and class label Y , and consider possible situations where different modules of the causal model change with the domain. In each situation, we investigate what knowledge is appropriate to transfer and find the optimal target-domain hypothesis. This gives an intuitive interpretation of the assumptions underlying certain previous methods and motivates new ones. We finally focus on the case where Y is the cause for X with changing PY and PXjY , that is, PY and PXjY change independently across domains. Under appropriate assumptions, the availability of multiple source domains allows a natural way to reconstruct the conditional distribution on the target domain; we propose to model PXjY (the process to generate effect X from cause Y ) on the target domain as a linear mixture of those on source domains, and estimate all involved parameters by matching the target-domain feature distribution. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data verify our theoretical results.},

  abstract = {The study of dependence between random variables is a mainstay in statistics. In many cases, the strength of dependence between two or more random variables varies according to the values of a measured covariate. We propose inference for this type of variation using a conditional copula model where the copula function belongs to a parametric copula family and the copula parameter varies with the covariate. In order to estimate the functional relationship between the copula parameter and the covariate, we propose a nonparametric approach based on local likelihood. Of importance is also the choice of the copula family that best represents a given set of data. The proposed framework naturally leads to a novel copula selection method based on cross-validated prediction errors. We derive the asymptotic bias and variance of the resulting local polynomial estimator, and outline how to construct pointwise confidence intervals. The finite-sample performance of our method is investigated using simulation studies and is illustrated using a subset of the Matched Multiple Birth data.},

In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic technique from robust statistics — to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to equires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.},

We mainly address the problem of estimating causal effects from observational data. For example, one can think of estimating the effect of single or multiple gene knockouts from wild-type gene expression data, that is, from gene expression measurements that were obtained without doing any gene knockout experiments. We assume that the observational data are generated from a causal structure that can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). First, we discuss estimation of causal effects when the underlying causal DAG is known. In large-scale networks, however, the causal DAG is often unknown. Next, we therefore discuss causal structure learning, that is, learning information about the causal structure from observational data. We then combine these two parts and discuss methods to estimate (bounds on) causal effects from observational data when the causal structure is unknown. We also illustrate this method on a yeast gene expression data set. We close by mentioning several extensions of the discussed work.},

Our method uses copulas to augment the families of distributions used in mean-field and structured approximations. Copulas model the dependency that is not captured by the original variational distribution, and thus the augmented variational family guarantees better approximations to the posterior. With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-field or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It is well-known that the placement of the knots in smoothing spline approximation has an important and considerable effect on the behavior of the final approximation [1]. However, as pointed out in [2], although spline for approximation is well understood, the knot placement problem has not been dealt with adequately. In the specialized bibliography, several methodologies have been presented for selection and optimization of parameters within B-spline, using techniques based on selecting knots called dominant points, adaptive knots placement, by data selection process, optimal control over the knots, and recently, by using paradigms from computational intelligent, and Bayesian model for automatically determining knot placement in spline modeling. However, a common two-step knot selection strategy, frequently used in the bibliography, is an homogeneous distribution of the knots or equally spaced approach [3]. In order to optimize the placement and numbers of knots required for approximation using smoothing splines, an Evolutionary Computation Paradigms (ECP) based on a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm has been developed, with the main purpose of avoiding the large number of local minima (in terms of approximation error for different system complexity or number of knots) existing in the problem of knots placement. The accuracy, computationally efficient and robustness of the algorithm presented will be compared by different experimental results, with other approaches presented in the bibliography, showing the main advantages of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several methods have been proposed for the discovery of causal structure from non-experimental data. Such methods make various assumptions on the data generating process to facilitate its identification from purely observational data. Continuing this line of research, we show how to discover the complete causal structure of continuous-valued data, under the assump-tions that (a) the data generating process is linear, (b) there are no unobserved confounders, and (c) disturbance variables have non-Gaussian distributions of non-zero variances. The solution relies on the use of the statistical method known as independent component analysis, and does not require any pre-specified time-ordering of the variables. We provide a complete Matlab package for per-forming this LiNGAM analysis (short for Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model), and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using artificially generated data and real-world data.},

The two-variable case is especially difficult to solve since it is not possible to use standard conditional independence tests between the variables. To tackle this problem, we follow an information theoretic approach based on Kolmogorov complexity and use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to provide a practical solution. In particular, we propose a compression scheme to encode local and global functional relations using MDL-based regression. We infer $X$ causes $Y$ in case it is shorter to describe $Y$ as a function of $X$ than the inverse direction. In addition, we introduce Slope, an efficient linear-time algorithm that through thorough empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real world data we show outperforms the state of the art by a wide margin.},

Here we argue why causal inference is also possible when only single observations are present. We develop a theory how to generate causal graphs explaining similarities between single objects. To this end, we replace the notion of conditional stochastic independence in the causal Markov condition with the vanishing of conditional algorithmic mutual information and describe the corresponding causal inference rules. We explain why a consistent reformulation of causal inference in terms of algorithmic complexity implies a new inference principle that takes into account also the complexity of conditional probability densities, making it possible to select among Markov equivalent causal graphs. This insight provides a theoretical foundation of a heuristic principle proposed in earlier work. We also discuss how to replace Kolmogorov complexity with decidable complexity criteria. This can be seen as an algorithmic analog of replacing the empirically undecidable question of statistical independence with practical independence tests that are based on implicit or explicit assumptions on the underlying distribution.},

  volume   = {64},
  number   = {1},
  abstract = {—We propose a novel statistical model to describe spatio-temporal extreme events. The model can be used, for instance, to estimate extreme-value temporal pattern such as seasonality and trend, and further to predict the distribution of extreme events in the future. Such model usually involves thou-sands or even millions of variables in the spatio-temporal domain, whereas only one single observation is available for each location and time point. To address this challenge, previous works usually employ learning and inference methods that are computationally burdensome, and therefore are prohibitive for large-scale data. Moreover, they assume that the shape and scale parameters of the extreme-value distributions are constant across the spatio-tem-poral domain, which is often too restrictive in practice. In this paper, we break through these limitations by exploring graphical models to capture the highly structured dependencies among the parameters of extreme-value distributions. Furthermore, we de-velop an efficient stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm to learn the parameters of the resulting non-Gaussian graphical model. The computational complexity of the SVI algorithm is sublinear in the number of variables, thus enabling the proposed model to tackle large-scale spatio-temporal data in real-life appli-cations. Results of both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

It combines established methods to model (spatial) dependencies. On the one hand spatial differences between the variable locations are utilized to model the degree of spatial dependence. On the other hand the flexible class of C-vine copulas are used to model the spatial dependency structure locally. These local C-vine copulas are parametrized jointly, exploiting a relationship between the copula parameters and the corresponding spatial distances and elevation differences, and are combined in a composite likelihood approach. This spatial local C-vine composite likelihood (S-LCVCL) method benefits from the fact that it is able to capture non-Gaussian dependency structures. The development and validation of the new methodology is illustrated using a data set of daily mean temperatures observed at 73 observation stations spread over Germany. For validation continuous ranked probability scores are utilized. Comparison with another vine copula based approach and a Gaussian approach for spatial dependency modeling shows a preference for vine copula based (spatial) dependency structures.},

Traditional robust regression methods assume that the noise distribution is symmetric, and they downweight the influence of so-called outliers. When the noise distribution is asymmetric, these methods yield biased regression estimators. Motivated by data-mining problems for the insurance industry, we propose a new approach to robust regression tailored to deal with asymmetric noise distribution. The main idea is to learn most of the parameters of the model using conditional quantile estimators (which are biased but robust estimators of the regression) and to learn a few remaining parameters to combine and correct these estimators, to minimize the average squared error in an unbiased way. Theoretical analysis and experiments show the clear advantages of the approach. Results are on artificial data as well as insurance data, using both linear and neural network predictors.},

  abstract  = {The discovery of causal relationships between a set of observed variables is a fun-damental problem in science. For continuous-valued data linear acyclic causal models with additive noise are often used because these models are well under-stood and there are well-known methods to fit them to data. In reality, of course, many causal relationships are more or less nonlinear, raising some doubts as to the applicability and usefulness of purely linear methods. In this contribution we show that the basic linear framework can be generalized to nonlinear models. In this extended framework, nonlinearities in the data-generating process are in fact a blessing rather than a curse, as they typically provide information on the underly-ing causal system and allow more aspects of the true data-generating mechanisms to be identified. In addition to theoretical results we show simulations and some simple real data experiments illustrating the identification power provided by non-linearities.},

  abstract  = {In factor copula models for multivariate data, dependence is explained via one or several common factors. These models are flexible in handling tail dependence and asymmetry with parsimonious dependence structures. We propose two structured factor copula models for the case where variables can be split into non-overlapping groups such that there is homogeneous dependence within each group. A typical example of such variables occurs for stock returns from different sectors. The structured models inherit most of dependence properties derived for common factor copula models. With appropriate numerical methods, efficient estimation of dependence parameters is possible for data sets with over 100 variables. We apply the structured factor copula models to analyze a financial data set, and compare with other copula models for tail inference. Using model-based interval estimates, we find that some commonly used risk measures may not be well discriminated by copula models, but tail-weighted dependence measures can discriminate copula models with different dependence and tail properties.},

  abstract      = {Probabilistic modeling is iterative. A scientist posits a simple model, fits it to her data, refines it according to her analysis, and repeats. However, fitting complex models to large data is a bottleneck in this process. Deriving algorithms for new models can be both mathematically and computationally challenging, which makes it difficult to efficiently cycle through the steps. To this end, we develop automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). Using our method, the scientist only provides a probabilistic model and a dataset, nothing else. ADVI automatically derives an efficient variational inference algorithm, freeing the scientist to refine and explore many models. ADVI supports a broad class of models-no conjugacy assumptions are required. We study ADVI across ten different models and apply it to a dataset with millions of observations. ADVI is integrated into Stan, a probabilistic programming system; it is available for immediate use.},

They generalize linear regression by replacing the linear combination $\alpha$0Tx with a nonparametric component, $\eta$0($\alpha$0Tx), where $\eta$0({\textperiodcentered}) is an unknown univariate link function. By reducing the dimensionality from that of a general covariate vector x to a univariate index $\alpha$0Tx, single-index models avoid the so-called “curse of dimensionality.” We propose penalized spline (P-spline) estimation of $\eta$0({\textperiodcentered}) in partially linear single-index models, where the mean function has the form $\eta$0($\alpha$0Tx) + $\beta$ 0Tz. The P-spline approach offers a number of advantages over other fitting methods for single-index models. All parameters in the P-spline single-index model can be estimated simultaneously by penalized nonlinear least squares. As a direct least squares fitting method, our approach is rapid and computationally stable. Standard nonlinear least squares software can be used. Moreover, joint inference for $\eta$0({\textperiodcentered}), $\alpha$0, and $\beta$0 is possible by...},

  abstract      = {Most causal inference algorithms in the literature (e.g., Pearl (2000), Spirtes et al. (2000), Heckerman et al. (1999)) exploit an assumption usually referred to as the causal Faithfulness or Stability condition. In this paper, we highlight two components of the condition used in constraint-based algorithms, which we call "Adjacency-Faithfulness" and "Orientation-Faithfulness". We point out that assuming Adjacency-Faithfulness is true, it is in principle possible to test the validity of Orientation-Faithfulness. Based on this observation, we explore the consequence of making only the Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. We show that the familiar PC algorithm has to be modified to be (asymptotically) correct under the weaker, Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. Roughly the modified algorithm, called Conservative PC (CPC), checks whether Orientation-Faithfulness holds in the orientation phase, and if not, avoids drawing certain causal conclusions the PC algorithm would draw. However, if the stronger, standard causal Faithfulness condition actually obtains, the CPC algorithm is shown to output the same pattern as the PC algorithm does in the large sample limit. We also present a simulation study showing that the CPC algorithm runs almost as fast as the PC algorithm, and outputs significantly fewer false causal arrowheads than the PC algorithm does on realistic sample sizes. We end our paper by discussing how score-based algorithms such as GES perform when the Adjacency-Faithfulness but not the standard causal Faithfulness condition holds, and how to extend our work to the FCI algorithm, which allows for the possibility of latent variables.},

abstract = {This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

These seasonalities are also the dominant source for the underlying misspecifications of the various volatility models. Therefore, an obvious route is to filter out the underlying intraday seasonalities from the data. In this paper, we propose a simple method for intraday seasonality extraction that is free of model selection parameters which may affect other intraday seasonality filtering methods. Our methodology is based on a wavelet multi-scaling approach which decomposes the data into its low- and high-frequency components through the application of a non-decimated discrete wavelet transform. It is simple to calculate, does not depend on a particular model selection criterion or model-specific parameter choices. The proposed filtering method is translation invariant, has the ability to decompose an arbitrary length series without boundary adjustments, is associated with a zero-phase filter and is circular. Being circular helps to preserve the entire sample unlike other two-sided filters where data loss occurs from the beginning and the end of the studied sample.},

An important novel aspect of our work is that we do not restrict the model class, but instead put general non-parametric priors on this function and on the distribution of the cause. The causal direction can then be inferred by using standard Bayesian model selection. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and real-world data and report encouraging results.},

These are directed acyclic graph (DAG) models with two kinds of variables, primary and secondary. The secondary variables are used to aid in the estimation of the structure of causal relationships between the primary variables. We prove that, under certain assumptions, such causal structure is identifiable from the joint observational distribution of the primary and secondary variables. We give causal semantics for the model class, put forward a score-based approach for estimation and establish consistency results. Empirical results demonstrate gains compared with formulations that treat all variables on an equal footing, or that ignore secondary variables. The methodology is motivated by applications in biology that involve multiple data types and is illustrated here using simulated data and in an analysis of molecular data from the Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Our model fits the market quotes for actively traded CDO tranches exactly. It is easy to understand and is a useful tool for pricing, trading, and risk management. It enables non-standard credit derivatives, such as bespoke CDOs and CDO squareds, to be priced consistently with market quotes for tranches of standard CDOs. Contrary to some of the criticisms that have been made of the approach, we find that it is more stable than the Gaussian copula/base correlation approach. Indeed our results suggest that the spreads given by the latter approach sometimes permit arbitrage.},

  abstract    = {There is increasing demand for models of time-varying and non-Gaussian dependencies for mul- tivariate time-series. Available models suffer from the curse of dimensionality or restrictive assumptions on the parameters and the distribution. A promising class of models are the hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC) that allow for non-exchangeable and non-Gaussian dependency structures with a small number of parameters. In this paper we develop a novel adaptive estimation technique of the parameters and of the structure of HAC for time-series. The approach relies on a local change point detection procedure and a locally constant HAC approximation. Typical applications are in the financial area but also recently in the spatial analysis of weather parameters. We analyse the time varying dependency structure of stock indices and exchange rates. We find that for stock indices the copula parameter changes dynam- ically but the hierarchical structure is constant over time. Interestingly in our exchange rate example both structure and parameters vary dynamically.},

Throughout the chapter, the general results are also specialized to common econometric estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific examples we work through the conditions for the various results in detail. The results are also extended to two-step estimators (with finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators (with nonparametric estimation of an infinite-dimensional parameter in the first step).

  abstract = {We present new measures of the causal direction, or direction of effect, between two non-Gaussian random variables. They are based on the likelihood ratio under the linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM). We also develop simple first-order approximations of the likelihood ratio and analyze them based on related cumulant-based measures, which can be shown to find the correct causal directions. We show how to apply these measures to estimate LiNGAM for more than two variables, and even in the case of more variables than observations. We further extend the method to cyclic and nonlinear models. The proposed framework is statistically at least as good as existing ones in the cases of few data points or noisy data, and it is computationally and conceptually very simple. Results on simulated fMRI data indicate that the method may be useful in neuroimaging where the number of time points is typically quite small.},

We first review the scientific motivation for CFL, then present a detailed introduction to the framework, laying out the definitions and algorithmic steps. A simple example illustrates the techniques involved in the learning steps and provides visual intuition. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current framework and list a number of open problems.},

This comment investigates the effect which occurs under misspecification of the parametric model. We demonstrate by means of several examples that even for a one or two-dimensional predictor the error caused by a ?wrong? specification of the parametric family is rather severe, if the regression is not monotone in one of the components of the predictor. Moreover, we also show that these problems occur for all of the commonly used copula families and we illustrate in several examples that the copula-based regression may lead to invalid results even when flexible copula models such as vine copulas (with the common parametric families) are used in the estimation procedure.},

To select features that have complex nonlinear relationships with the response variable, the dependence measure should be equitable; i.e., it should treat linear and nonlinear relation-ships equally. In this paper, we introduce the concept of robust-equitability and iden-tify a robust-equitable dependence measure robust copula dependence (RCD). This mea-sure has the following advantages compared to existing dependence measures: it is robust to different relationship forms and robust to unequal sample sizes of different features. In contrast, existing dependence measures can-not take these factors into account simulta-neously. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm our theoretical anal-ysis, and illustrate its advantage in feature selection.},

  title    = {{Causal Inference on Event Sequences}},
  abstract = {Given two event sequences, i.e. two discrete valued time series, of length n can we tell whether they are causally related? ?at is, can we tell whether x n causes n , whether n causes x n ? Can we do so without having to make assumptions on the distribution of these time series, or about the lag of the causal eeect? And, importantly for practical application, can we do so accurately and eeciently? are exactly the questions we answer in this paper. We propose a causal inference framework for event sequences based on information theory. We build upon the well-known notion of Granger causality, and deene causality in terms of compression. We infer that time series x n is likely a cause of time series n if n can be compressed (much) beeer given the past of x n than the other way around. To compress the event sequences, we use minimax optimal codes with respect to a parametric family of distributions. To show this works in practice, we propose CUTE, a linear time method for inferring the causal direction between two event sequences. Empirical evaluation shows that CUTE works well in practice, is much more robust than transfer entropy, and ably reconstructs the ground truth on river row and spike train data. 1 Introduction Telling cause from eeect from data that was not collected through carefully controlled randomized trials, i.e. observa-tional data, is one of the fundamental problems in science. We consider the case where we are given two discrete-valued time series—event sequences—of length n, and have to de-termine whether it is more likely that x n caused n , or the other way around, that n caused x n . Perhaps the most well-known framework for causal in-ference on time series is Granger causality, which postulates that x n is likely a cause of n if the past values of x n help to signiicantly beeer predict the values of n than we can do with just the data over the past of n . Typically predictabil-ity is measured in terms of variance of the error. While this framework makes intuitive sense, to put it to practice it does require us to make assumptions on the generating process, as well as on the measure of predictability. In this paper we take a related, but subtly diierent approach. We take an information theoretic viewpoint and deene causality in terms of compression. Simply put, we say that X causes Y if we save more bits by compressing the},

We show that the influence function of a semiparametric estimator can be calculated as the limit of the Gateaux derivative of a parameter with respect to a smooth deviation as the deviation approaches a point mass. We also consider high level and primitive regularity conditions for validity of the influence function calculation. The conditions involve Frechet differentiability, nonparametric convergence rates, stochastic equicontinuity, and small bias conditions. We apply these results to examples.},

  abstract  = {Studying phenomena that follow a skewed distribution and entail an extremal behaviour is important in many disciplines. How to describe and model the dependence of skewed spatial random fields is still a challenging question. Especially when one is interested in interpolating a sample from a spatial random field that exhibits extreme events, classical geostatistical tools like kriging relying on the Gaussian assumption fail in reproducing the extremes. Originating from the multivariate extreme value theory partly driven by financial mathematics, copulas emerged in recent years being capable of describing different kinds of joint tail behaviours beyond the Gaussian realm. In this paper spatial vine copulas are introduced that are parametrized by distance and allow to include extremal behaviour of a spatial random field. The newly introduced distributions are fitted to the widely studied emergency and routine scenario data set from the spatial interpolation comparison 2004 (SIC2004). The presented spatial vine copula ranks within the top 5 approaches and is superior to all approaches in terms of the mean absolute error.},

  abstract      = {Copula modeling has become ubiquitous in modern statistics. Here, the problem of nonparametrically estimating a copula density is addressed. Arguably the most popular nonparametric density estimator, the kernel estimator is not suitable for the unit-square-supported copula densities, mainly because it is heavily affected by boundary bias issues. In addition, most common copulas admit unbounded densities, and kernel methods are not consistent in that case. In this paper, a kernel-type copula density estimator is proposed. It is based on the idea of transforming the uniform marginals of the copula density into normal distributions via the probit function, estimating the density in the transformed domain, which can be accomplished without boundary problems, and obtaining an estimate of the copula density through back-transformation. Although natural, a raw application of this procedure was, however, seen not to perform very well in the earlier literature. Here, it is shown that, if combined with local likelihood density estimation methods, the idea yields very good and easy to implement estimators, fixing boundary issues in a natural way and able to cope with unbounded copula densities. The asymptotic properties of the suggested estimators are derived, and a practical way of selecting the crucially important smoothing parameters is devised. Finally, extensive simulation studies and a real data analysis evidence their excellent performance compared to their main competitors.},

(2013) proposed a new semiparametric estimate of a regression function with a multivariate predictor, which is based on a speci?cation of the dependence structure between the predictor and the response by means of a parametric copula. This paper investigates the effect which occurs under misspecification of the parametric model. We demonstrate that even for a one or two dimensional predictor the error caused by a \wrong" speci?cation of the parametric family is rather severe, if the regression is not monotone in one of the components of the predictor. Moreover, we also show that these problems occur for all of the commonly used copula families and we illustrate in several examples that the copula-based regression may lead to invalid results even when more exible copula models such as vine copulae (with the common parametric families) are used in the estimation procedure.},

This paper contributes to the study of semiparametric estimation of conditional copulas by starting from a parametric copula function in which the parameter varies with a covariate, and leaving the marginals unspecified. Consequently, the unknown parts in the model are the parameter function and the unknown marginals. The authors use a local pseudo-likelihood with nonparametrically estimated marginals approximating the unknown parameter function locally by a polynomial. Under this general setting, they prove the consistency of the estimators of the parameter function as well as its derivatives; they also establish asymptotic normality. Furthermore, they derive an expression for the theoretical optimal bandwidth and discuss practical bandwidth selection. They illustrate the performance of the estimation procedure with data-driven bandwidth selection via a simulation study and a real-data case.},

  month         = apr,
  abstract      = {In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic international portfolio optimisation model to find an optimal allocation for the combination of both assets and currency hedging positions. Our optimisation model allows a "currency overlay", or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to provide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency exposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are also included. To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return distributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine copula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of the characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and asymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the uncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio optimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated from the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a standard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the proposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios that give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario generation approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return compensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher returns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the non-normality in uncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.},

  abstract      = {Instrumental variables are widely used in applied econometrics to achieve identification and carry out estimation and inference in models that contain endogenous explanatory variables. In most applications, the function of interest (e.g., an Engel curve or demand function) is assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters (e.g., a linear model), and instrumental variables are used to identify and estimate these parameters. However, linear and other finite-dimensional parametric models make strong assumptions about the population being modeled that are rarely if ever justified by economic theory or other a priori reasoning and can lead to seriously erroneous conclusions if they are incorrect. This paper explores what can be learned when the function of interest is identified through an instrumental variable but is not assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters. The paper explains the differences between parametric and nonparametric estimators that are important for applied research, describes an easily implemented nonparametric instrumental variables estimator, and presents empirical examples in which nonparametric methods lead to substantive conclusions that are quite different from those obtained using standard, parametric estimators.

  abstract  = {We present a new algorithm for Bayesian network structure learning, called Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC). The algorithm combines ideas from local learning, constraint-based, and search-and-score techniques in a principled and effective way. It first reconstructs the skeleton of a Bayesian network and then performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges. In our extensive empirical evaluation MMHC out-performs on average and in terms of various metrics several prototypical and state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the PC, Sparse Candidate, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, Greedy Equivalence Search, and Greedy Search. These are the first empirical re-sults simultaneously comparing most of the major Bayesian network algorithms against each other. MMHC offers certain theoretical advantages, specifically over the Sparse Candidate algorithm, corroborated by our experiments. MMHC and detailed results of our study are publicly available at},

Considering multiple profiles gives the opportunity to correct for systematic biases observed on single profiles, such as probe GC content or the so-called “wave effect.” In this article, we extend the segmentation model developed in the univariate case to the joint analysis of multiple CGH profiles. Our contribution is multiple: we propose an integrated model to perform joint segmentation, normalization, and calling for multiple array CGH profiles. This model shows great flexibility, especially in the modeling of the wave effect that gives a likelihood framework to approaches proposed by others. We propose a new dynamic programming algorithm for break point positioning, as well as a model selection criterion based on a modified bayesian information criterion proposed in the univariate case. The performance of our method is assessed using simulated and real data sets. Our method is implemented in the R package cghseg.},

Differently from earlier papers, our definition is not based on a distribution function but on functional properties, and does not need a reference to a related max-stable process. As an application, we use the theory to simulate wind fields connected to disastrous storms on the basis of observed extreme but not disastrous storms.

While parameters may be estimated by maximum likelihood, confidence intervals are difficult to obtain. Consequently, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and compute credible intervals. Standard errors obtained from MCMC output are compared to those obtained from a numerical Hessian matrix and bootstrapping. As applications, we consider Norwegian financial returns and Euro swap rates.

In the context of generalized linear mixed models, this paper exploits the link between random effects and penalized regression to develop a simple test for a zero effect. The idea is to treat the variance components not being tested as fixed at their estimates and then to express the likelihood ratio as a readily computed quadratic form in the predicted values of the random effects. Under the null hypothesis this has the distribution of a weighted sum of squares of independent standard normal random variables. The test can be used with generalized linear mixed models, including those estimated by penalized quasilikelihood.},

Estimation and inference is usually done via maximum likelihood. Although some progress has been made recently, a complete distribution theory of MLE for EGARCH models is still missing. Furthermore, the estimation procedure itself may be highly sensitive to starting values, the choice of numerical optimation algorithm, etc. We present an alternative estimator that is available in a simple closed form and which could be used, for example, as starting values for MLE. The estimator of the dynamic parameter is independent of the innovation distribution. For the other parameters we assume that the innovation distribution belongs to the class of Generalized Error Distributions (GED), profiling out its parameter in the estimation procedure. We discuss the properties of the proposed estimator and illustrate its performance in a simulation study.},

Recent advances in single-molecule-based technologies have achieved unprecedented resolution, and were the basis of the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2014. In this article, we focus on developments in camera technologies and associated image processing that have been a major driver of technical innovations in light microscopy.

  abstract  = {Generalized additive models (GAMs) have distinct advantages over generalized linear models as they allow investigators to make inferences about associations between outcomes and predictors without placing parametric restrictions on the associations. The variable of interest is often smoothed using a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) and the optimal span (degree of smoothing) can be determined by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A natural hypothesis when using GAMs is to test whether the smoothing term is necessary or if a simpler model would suffice. The statistic of interest is the difference in deviances between models including and excluding the smoothed term. As approximate chi-square tests of this hypothesis are known to be biased, permutation tests are a reasonable alternative.Wecompare the type I error rates of the chisquare test and of three permutation test methods using synthetic data generated under the null hypothesis. In each permutation method a distribution of differences in deviances is obtained from 999 permuted datasets and the null hypothesis is rejected if the observed statistic falls in the upper 5% of the distribution. One test is a conditional permutation test using the optimal span size for the observed data; this span size is held constant for all permutations. This test is shown to have an inflated type I error rate. Alternatively, the span size can be fixed a priori such that the span selection technique is not reliant on the observed data. This test is shown to be unbiased; however, the choice of span size is not clear. A third method is an unconditional permutation test where the optimal span size is selected for observed and permuted datasets. This test is unbiased though computationally intensive. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {This book, and the associated software, have grown out of the author's work in the ﬁeld of local regression over the past several years. The book is designed to be useful for both theoretical work and in applications. Most chapters contain distinct sections introducing methodology, computing and practice, and theoretical results. The methodological and practice sections should be accessible to readers with a sound background in statistical methods and in particular regression, for example at the level of Draper and Smith (1981). The theoretical sections require a greater understanding of calculus, matrix algebra and real analysis, generally at the level found in advanced undergraduate courses. Applications are given from a wide variety of ﬁelds, ranging from actuarial science to sports. The extent, and relevance, of early work in smoothing is not widely appreciated, even within the research community. Chapter 1 attempts to redress the problem. Many ideas that are central to modern work on smoothing: local polynomials, the bias-variance trade-oﬀ, equivalent kernels, likelihood models and optimality results can be found in literature dating to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The core methodology of this book appears in Chapters 2 through 5. These chapters introduce the local regression method in univariate and multivariate settings, and extensions to local likelihood and density estimation. Basic theoretical results and diagnostic tools such as cross validation are introduced along the way. Examples illustrate the implementation of the methods using the locfit software. The remaining chapters discuss a variety of applications and advanced topics: classiﬁcation, survival data, bandwidth selection issues, computa- tion and asymptotic theory. Largely, these chapters are independent of each other, so the reader can pick those of most interest. Most chapters include a short set of exercises. These include theoretical results; details of proofs; extensions of the methodology; some data analysis examples and a few research problems. But the real test for the methods is whether they provide useful answers in applications. The best exercise for every chapter is to ﬁnd datasets of interest, and try the methods out! The literature on mathematical aspects of smoothing is extensive, and coverage is necessarily selective. I attempt to present results that are of most direct practical relevance. For example, theoretical motivation for standard error approximations and conﬁdence bands is important; the reader should eventually want to know precisely what the error estimates represent, rather than simply asuming software reports the right answers (this applies to any model and software; not just local regression and locfit!). On the other hand, asymptotic methods for boundary correction receive no coverage, since local regression provides a simpler, more intuitive and more general approach to achieve the same result. Along with the theory, we also attempt to introduce understanding of the results, along with their relevance. Examples of this include the discussion of non-identiﬁability of derivatives (Section 6.1) and the problem of bias estimation for conﬁdence bands and bandwidth selectors (Chapters 9 and 10).},

The class of d-dimensional Archimedean copulas is shown to coincide with the class of survival copulas of d-dimensional 1-norm symmetric distributions that place no point mass at the origin. The d-monotone Archimedean copula generators may be characterized using a little-known integral transform of Williamson [Duke Math. J. 23 (1956) 189-207] in an analogous manner to the well-known Bernstein-Widder characterization of completely monotone generators in terms of the Laplace transform. These insights allow the construction of new Archimedean copula families and provide a general solution to the problem of sampling multivariate Archimedean copulas. They also yield useful expressions for the d-dimensional Kendall function and Kendall's rank correlation coefficients and facilitate the derivation of results on the existence of densities and the description of singular components for Archimedean copulas. The existence of a sharp lower bound for Archimedean copulas with respect to the positive lower orthant dependence ordering is shown.},

  abstract  = {The frequency properties of Wahba's Bayesian confidence intervals for smoothing splines are investigated by a large-sample approximation and by a simulation study. When the coverage probabilities for these pointwise confidence intervals are averaged across the observation points, the average coverage probability (ACP) should be close to the nomial level. From a frequency point of view, this agreement occurs because the average posterior variance for the spline is similar to a consistent estimate of the average squared error and because the average squared bias is a modest fraction of the total average squared error. These properties are independent of the Bayesian assumptions used to derive this confidence procedure, and they explain why the ACP is accurate for functions that are much smoother than the sample paths prescribed by the prior. This analysis accounts for the choice of the smoothing parameter (bandwidth) using cross-validation. In the case of natural splines an adaptive method for avoiding boundary effects is considered. The main disadvantage of this approach is that these confidence intervals are only valid in an average sense and may not be reliable if only evaluated at peaks or troughs in the estimate.

  abstract      = {Causal discovery via the asymmetry between the cause and the effect has proved to be a promising way to infer the causal direction from obser-vations. The basic idea is to assume that the mechanism generating the cause distribution p(x) and that generating the conditional distribution p(y|x) correspond to two independent natural processes and thus p(x) and p(y|x) fulfill some sort of independence condition. However, in many situations, the independence condition does not hold for the anticausal direction; if we consider p(x, y) as generated via p(y)p(x|y), then there are usually some contrived mutual adjustments between p(y) and p(x|y). This kind of asymmetry can be exploited to identify the causal direction. Based on this postulate, in this letter, we define an uncorrelatedness crite-rion between p(x) and p(y|x) and, based on this uncorrelatedness, show asymmetry between the cause and the effect in terms that a certain com-plexity metric on p(x) and p(y|x) is less than the complexity metric on p(y) and p(x|y). We propose a Hilbert space embedding-based method EMD (an abbreviation for EMbeDding) to calculate the complexity metric and show that this method preserves the relative magnitude of the complexity metric. Based on the complexity metric, we propose an efficient kernel-based algorithm for causal discovery. The contribution of this letter is threefold. It allows a general transformation from the cause to the effect involving the noise effect and is applicable to both one-dimensional and high-dimensional data. Furthermore it can be used to infer the causal ordering for multiple variables. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Our contribution, through this study, is to introduce a new class of models for multivariate discrete data based on pair copula constructions (PCCs) that has two major advantages. First, by deriving the conditions under which any multivariate discrete distribution can be decomposed as a PCC, we show that discrete PCCs attain highly flexible dependence structures. Second, the computational burden of evaluating the likelihood for an m-dimensional discrete PCC only grows quadratically with in. This compares favorably to existing models for which computing the likelihood either requires the evaluation of 2(m) terms or slow numerical integration methods. We demonstrate the high quality of inference function for margins and maximum likelihood estimates, both under a simulated setting and for an application to a longitudinal discrete dataset on headache severity.

The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks. Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology to a financial data set.

  abstract = {Copulas have attracted significant attention in the recent literature for modeling multivariate observations. An important feature of copulas is that they enable us to specify the univariate marginal distributions and their joint behavior separately. The copula parameter captures the intrinsic dependence between the marginal variables and it can be estimated by parametric or semiparametric methods. For practical applications, the so called inference function for margins (IFM) method has emerged as the preferred fully parametric method because it is close to maximum likelihood (ML) in approach and is easier to implement. The purpose of this paper is to compare the ML and IFM methods with a semiparametric (SP) method that treats the univariate marginal distributions as unknown functions. In this paper, we consider the SP method proposed by Genest et al. [1995. A semiparametric estimation procedure of dependence parameters in multivariate families of distributions. Biometrika 82(3), 543-552], which has attracted considerable interest in the literature. The results of an extensive simulation study reported here show that the ML/IFM methods are nonrobust against misspecification of the marginal distributions, and that the SP method performs better than the ML and IFM methods, overall. A data example on household expenditure is used to illustrate the application of various data analytic methods for applying the SP method, and to compare and contrast the ML, IFM and SP methods. The main conclusion is that, in terms of statistical computations and data analysis, the SP method is better than ML and IFM methods when the marginal distributions are unknown which is almost always the case in practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In regression, the desired estimate of y|x is not always given by a conditional mean, although this is most common. Sometimes one wants to obtain a good estimate that satisfies the property that a proportion, $\tau$, of y|x, will be below the estimate. For $\tau$ = 0.5 this is an estimate of the median. What might be called median regression, is subsumed under the term quantile regression. We present a nonparametric version of a quantile estimator, which can be obtained by solving a simple quadratic programming problem and provide uniform convergence statements and bounds on the quantile property of our estimator. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach and competitiveness of our method with existing ones. We discuss several types of extensions including an approach to solve the quantile crossing problems, as well as a method to incorporate prior qualitative knowledge such as monotonicity constraints.},

Association measures such as Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho can be expressed as functionals of the copula. The dependence structure between two variables can be highly influenced by a covariate, and it is of real interest to know how this dependence structure changes with the value taken by the covariate. This motivates the need for introducing conditional copulas, and the associated conditional Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho association measures. After the introduction and motivation of these concepts, two nonparametric estimators for a conditional copula are proposed and discussed. Then nonparametric estimates for the conditional association measures are derived. A key issue is that these measures are now looked at as functions in the covariate. The performances of all estimators are investigated via a simulation study which also includes a data-driven algorithm for choosing the smoothing parameters. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated on two real data examples.},

  abstract  = {This paper establishes the consistency of the minimum description length (MDL) model selection procedure by [10, 11] for a class of non-stationary time series models. We consider a time series model in which the observations are viewed as coming from stationary segments. In other words, the data are assumed to come from a general time series model in which the parameters change at break-points. Each of these segments is modeled by a pre-specified family of parametric stationary time series models. [10, 11] formulated the above problem and used the minimum description length (MDL) principle to estimate the number of break-points, the location of the break-points, the order of the parametric model and the parameter values in each of the segments. The procedure performed well on a variety of examples. In this paper we show consistency of their minimal MDL model selection procedure under general regularity conditions on the likelihood function. Results about the rate of convergence of the break-point-location estimator are also given. Applications are considered for detecting changes in independent random variables, and in ARMA and GARCH processes.},

Hannan (1988) on optimization of histogram density estimators with equal bin widths by minimization of the stochastic complexity are extended and sharpened in two separate ways. As the first contribution, two generalized histogram estimators are constructed. The first has unequal bin widths which, together with the number of the bins, are determined by minimization of the stochastic complexity using dynamic programming. The other estimator consists of a mixture of equal bin width estimators, each of which is defined by the associated stochastic complexity. As the main contribution in the present work, two theorems are proved, which together extend the universal coding theorems to a large class of data generating densities. The first gives an asymptotic upper bound for the code redundancy in the order of magnitude, achieved with a special predictive type of histogram estimator, which sharpens a related bound. The second theorem states that this bound cannot be improved upon by any code whatsoever.},

The main idea behind this approach is to write the regression function in terms of a copula and marginal distributions. Once the copula and the marginal distributions are estimated, we use the plug-in method to construct our new estimator. Because various methods are available in the literature for estimating both a copula and a distribution, this idea provides a rich and flexible family of regression estimators. We provide some asymptotic results related to this copula-based regression modeling when the copula is estimated via profile likelihood and the marginals are estimated nonparametrically. We also study the finite sample performance of the estimator and illustrate its usefulness by analyzing data from air pollution studies.},

abstract = {Yersinia pestis is a highly pathogenic Gram-negative organism and the causative agent of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Y. pestis is capable of causing major epidemics; thus, there is a need for vaccine targets and a greater understanding of the role of these targets in pathogenesis. Two prime Y. pestis vaccine candidates are the usher-chaperone fimbriae Psa and Caf. Herein we report that Y. pestis requires, in a nonredundant manner, both PsaA and Caf1 to achieve its full pathogenic ability in both pneumonic and bubonic plague in C57BL/6J mice. Deletion of psaA leads to a decrease in the organ bacterial burden and to a significant increase in the 50% lethal dose (LD₅₀) after subcutaneous infection. Deletion of caf1 also leads to a significant decrease in the organ bacterial burden but more importantly leads to a significantly greater increase in the LD₅₀ than was observed for the $\Delta$psaA mutant strain after subcutaneous infection of C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, the degree of attenuation of the $\Delta$caf1 mutant strain is mouse background dependent, as the $\Delta$caf1 mutant strain was attenuated to a lesser degree in BALB/cJ mice by the subcutaneous route than in C57BL/6J mice. This observation that the degree of requirement for Caf1 is dependent on the mouse background indicates that the virulence of Y. pestis is dependent on the genetic makeup of its host and provides further support for the hypothesis that PsaA and Caf1 have different targets.},

The methods examined include the standard normal homogeneity (SNH) test, Wilcoxon?s nonparametric test, two-phase regression (TPR) procedures, inhomogeneity tests, information criteria procedures, and various variants thereof. All of these methods have been proposed in the climate literature to detect undocumented changepoints, but heretofore there has been little formal comparison of the techniques on either real or simulated climate series. This study seeks to unify the topic, showing clearly the fundamental differences among the assumptions made by each procedure and providing guidelines for which procedures work best in different situations. It is shown that the common trend TPR and Sawa?s Bayes criteria procedures seem optimal for most climate time series, whereas the SNH procedure and its nonparametric variant are probably best when trend and periodic effects can be diminished by using homogeneous reference series. Two applications to annual mean temperature series are given. Directions for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {This reviewpresents empirical researcherswith recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be un- dertaken in moving fromtraditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

From sample data with n = 2,000, an implementation of the algorithm on a Decstation 3100 recovers the edges in a linear version of the ALARM network with 37 vertices and 46 edges. Fewer than 8% of the undirected edges are incorrectly identified in the output. Without prior ordering information the program also determines the direction of edges for the ALARM graph with an error rate of 17%. Processing time is less than 15 seconds.},

  abstract = {We study the modeling of large data sets of high-frequency returns using a long-memory stochastic volatility (LMSV) model. Issues pertaining to estimation and forecasting of large data sets using the LMSV model are studied in detail. Furthermore, a new method of de-seasonalizing the volatility in high-frequency data is proposed, that allows for slowly varying seasonality. Using both simulated as well as real data, we compare the forecasting performance of the LMSV model for forecasting realized volatility (RV) to that of a linear long-memory model fit to the logRV. The performance of the new seasonal adjustment is also compared to a recently proposed procedure using real data.},

After reviewing concepts including manipulations, causal models, sample predictive modeling, causal predictive modeling, and structural equation models, we present the constraint-based approach to causal discovery, which relies on the conditional independence relationships in the data, and discuss the assumptions underlying its validity. We then focus on causal discovery based on structural equations models, in which a key issue is the identifiability of the causal structure implied by appropriately defined structural equation models: in the two-variable case, under what conditions (and why) is the causal direction between the two variables identifiable? We show that the independence between the error term and causes, together with appropriate structural constraints on the structural equation, makes it possible. Next, we report some recent advances in causal discovery from time series. Assuming that the causal relations are linear with nonGaussian noise, we mention two problems which are traditionally difficult to solve, namely causal discovery from subsampled data and that in the presence of confounding time series. Finally, we list a number of open questions in the field of causal discovery and inference.},

Our empirical analysis shows evidence for market incompleteness: a large proportion of risk in the CDO tranches appears to be unhedgeable. We also show that, unlike what is commonly assumed, dynamic models do not necessarily perform better than static models, nor do high-dimensional bottom-up models perform better than simpler top-down models. When it comes to hedging, topdown and regression-based hedging with the index provide significantly better results during the credit crisis than bottom-up hedging with single-name credit default swap (CDS) contracts. Our empirical study also reveals that while significantly large moves-'jumps'-do occur in CDS, index, and tranche spreads, these jumps do not necessarily occur on the default dates of index constituents, an observation which shows the insufficiency of some recently proposed portfolio credit risk models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

We exploit importance reweight-ing or sample transformation to find the learning machine that works well on test data, and propose to estimate the weights or transformations by reweighting or trans-forming training data to reproduce the covari-ate distribution on the test domain. Thanks to kernel embedding of conditional as well as marginal distributions, the proposed ap-proaches avoid distribution estimation, and are applicable for high-dimensional problems.

abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

In this paper, we show the importance of selecting an accurate copula for risk management. We extend standard goodness-of-fit tests to copulas. Contrary to existing, indirect tests, these tests can be applied to any copula of any dimension and are based on a direct comparison of a given copula with observed data. For a portfolio consisting of stocks, bonds and real estate, these tests provide clear evidence in favor of the Student's t copula, and reject both the correlation-based Gaussian copula and the extreme value-based Gumbel copula. In comparison with the Student's t copula, we find that the Gaussian copula underestimates the probability of joint extreme downward movements, while the Gumbel copula overestimates this risk. Similarly we establish that the Gaussian copula is too optimistic on diversification benefits, while the Gumbel copula is too pessimistic. Moreover, these differences are significant.},

Sequential detection is an online version in which new data is continually arriving and is analyzed adaptively. We are concerned with the related, but distinct, offline version, in which retrospective analysis of an entire sequence is performed. For a set of multivariate observations of arbitrary dimension, we consider nonparametric estimation of both the number of change points and the positions at which they occur. We do not make any assumptions regarding the nature of the change in distribution or any distribution assumptions beyond the existence of the alpha-th absolute moment, for some alpha in (0,2). Estimation is based on hierarchical clustering and we propose both divisive and agglomerative algorithms. The divisive method is shown to provide consistent estimates of both the number and location of change points under standard regularity assumptions. We compare the proposed approach with competing methods in a simulation study. Methods from cluster analysis are applied to assess performance and to allow simple comparisons of location estimates, even when the estimated number differs.

The regression structure is modeled by using four different link functions and the dependence between the Bernoulli trials is modeled by using three different correlation functions. A data augmentation scheme is used in order to overcome the complexity of the mixture likelihood. A Bayesian method for inference is developed for the proposed model which relies on both the data augmentation scheme and the MCMC algorithms to obtain the posterior estimate for the parameters. Two types of Bayesian residuals and a local influence measure from a Bayesian perspective are proposed to check the underlying model assumptions, as well as to identify the presence of outliers and/or influential observations. Simulation studies are presented in order to illustrate the performance of the developed methodology. A real data set is analyzed by using the proposed models.},

They describe and interpret the results of a large Monte Carlo experiment designed to assess the effect of the sample size and the strength of dependence on the level and power of the blanket tests for various combinations of copula models under the null hypothesis and the alternative.

  abstract = {The regional flood frequency hydrology of the 86,000km2 and semi-arid Ebro catchment is investigated using an extended generalised least square model that includes separate descriptions for sampling errors and model errors. The Ebro catchment is characterised by large hydro-climatic heterogeneities among sub-regions. However, differences in flood processes among sites are better explained by a set of new catchment descriptors introduced into hydrological regression models, such as new characteristics derived from the slope of flow duration curves, the ratio of mean annual precipitation to extreme precipitations and the aridity index. These additions enabled a more direct link to be established between the general flow regime and the extreme flood characteristics through-out the entire catchment. The new regression models developed in this study were compared to a set of existing models recommended for flood frequency estimation in Spain. It was found that the generalised least squares model developed in this study improves the existing ordinary least squares models both at regional and trans-regional scales. An adequate description of flood processes is obtained and, as a direct consequence, more reliable flood predictions in ungauged catchments are achieved.},

Consider model classes consisting of models of given maximal (Kolmogorov) complexity. The ``structure function'' of the given data expresses the relation between the complexity level constraint on a model class and the least log-cardinality of a model in the class containing the data. We show that the structure function determines all stochastic properties of the data: for every constrained model class it determines the individual best-fitting model in the class irrespective of whether the ``true'' model is in the model class considered or not. In this setting, this happens {\em with certainty}, rather than with high probability as is in the classical case. We precisely quantify the goodness-of-fit of an individual model with respect to individual data. We show that--within the obvious constraints--every graph is realized by the structure function of some data. We determine the (un)computability properties of the various functions contemplated and of the ``algorithmic minimal sufficient statistic.''},

  abstract = {In applied fields, practitioners hoping to apply causal structure learning or causal orientation algorithms face an important question: which independence test is appropriate for my data? In the case of real-valued iid data, linear dependencies, and Gaussian error terms, partial correlation is sufficient. But once any of these assumptions is modified, the situation becomes more complex. Kernel-based tests of independence have gained popularity to deal with nonlinear dependencies in recent years, but testing for conditional independence remains a challenging problem. We highlight the important issue of non-iid observations: when data are observed in space, time, or on a network, “nearby” observations are likely to be similar. This fact biases estimates of dependence between variables. Inspired by the success of Gaussian process regression for handling non-iid observations in a wide variety of areas and by the usefulness of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), a kernel-based independence test, we propose a simple framework to address all of these issues: first, use Gaussian process regression to control for certain variables and to obtain residuals. Second, use HSIC to test for independence. We illustrate this on two classic datasets, one spatial, the other temporal, that are usually treated as iid. We show how properly accounting for spatial and temporal variation can lead to more reasonable causal graphs. We also show how highly structured data, like images and text, can be used in a causal inference framework using a novel structured input/output Gaussian process formulation. We demonstrate this idea on a dataset of translated sentences, trying to predict the source language.},

We propose a vine copula autoencoder to construct flexible generative models for high-dimensional distributions in a straightforward three-step procedure. First, an autoencoder compresses the data using a lower dimensional representation. Second, the multivariate distribution of the encoded data is estimated with vine copulas. Third, a generative model is obtained by combining the estimated distribution with the decoder part of the autoencoder. This approach can transform any already trained autoencoder into a flexible generative model at a low computational cost. This is an advantage over existing generative models such as adversarial networks and variational autoencoders which can be difficult to train and can impose strong assumptions on the latent space. Experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Large-Scale CelebFaces Attributes datasets show that vine copulas autoencoders can achieve competitive results to standard baselines.},

  abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental prob-lem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes X, given joint observations of two variables X, Y . An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery prob-lems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: methods based on Additive Noise Models (ANMs) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs that consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37 data sets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the " ground truth " causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially sim-ulated data. Our empirical results on real-world data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One * . Part of this work was done while JMM and JZ were with the MPI T{\"{u}}bingen, and JP with ETH Z{\"{u}}rich. of the best performing methods overall is the method based on Additive Noise Models that has originally been proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63 ± 10 % and an AUC of 0.74 ± 0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of this work we prove the consistency of that method.},

Functional causal models represent the effect as a function of the direct causes together with an independent noise term. Examples include the linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM), nonlinear additive noise model, and post-nonlinear (PNL) model. Currently there are two ways to estimate the parameters in the models; one is by dependence minimization, and the other is maximum likelihood. In this paper, we show that for any acyclic functional causal model, minimizing the mutual infor-mation between the hypothetical cause and the noise term is equivalent to maximizing the data likelihood with a flexible model for the distribution of the noise term. We then focus on estimation of the PNL causal model, and propose to estimate it with the warped Gaussian process with the noise modeled by the mixture of Gaussians. As a Bayesian nonparametric approach, it outperforms the previous one based on mutual in-formation minimization with nonlinear functions represented by multilayer perceptrons; we also show that unlike the ordinary regression, estimation results of the PNL causal model are sensitive to the assump-tion on the noise distribution. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical claims.},
